Transduction by this alpha subunit involves coupling of specific cell-surface receptors with a cGMP-phosphodiesterase; Activation of phosphodiesterase lowers intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP which may open a cyclic nucleotide-suppressible cation channel leading to influx of calcium, ultimately leading to release of neurotransmitter. Indeed, denatonium and strychnine induce transient reduction in cAMP and cGMP in taste tissue, whereas this decrease is inhibited by GNAT3 antibody. Gustducin heterotrimer transduces response to bitter and sweet compounds via regulation of phosphodiesterase for alpha subunit, as well as via activation of phospholipase C for beta and gamma subunits, with ultimate increase inositol trisphosphate and increase of intracellular Calcium. GNAT3 can functionally couple to taste receptors to transmit intracellular signal: receptor heterodimer TAS1R2/TAS1R3 senses sweetness and TAS1R1/TAS1R3 transduces umami taste, whereas the T2R family GPCRs act as bitter sensors. Functions also as lumenal sugar sensors in the gut to control the expression of the Na+-glucose transporter SGLT1 in response to dietaty sugar, as well as the secretion of Glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, GIP. Thus, may modulate the gut capacity to absorb sugars, with implications in malabsorption syndromes and diet-related disorders including diabetes and obesity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11917125, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17724330}.

Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Acts as a receptor for chemokines including CCL2, CCL3, CCL3L1, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL22, CCL23, CCL24, SCYA2/MCP-1, SCY3/MIP-1-alpha, SCYA5/RANTES and SCYA7/MCP-3. Upon active ligand stimulation, activates a beta-arrestin 1 (ARRB1)-dependent, G protein-independent signaling pathway that results in the phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein cofilin (CFL1) through a RAC1-PAK1-LIMK1 signaling pathway. Activation of this pathway results in up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation. By scavenging chemokines in tissues, on the surfaces of lymphatic vessels, and in placenta, plays an essential role in the resolution (termination) of the inflammatory response and in the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Plays a major role in the immune silencing of macrophages during the resolution of inflammation. Acts as a regulator of inflammatory leukocyte interactions with lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and is required for immature/mature dendritic cells discrimination by LECs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23479571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23633677}.

O14579	COPE_HUMAN	Coatomer subunit epsilon (Epsilon-coat protein) (Epsilon-COP)	Homo sapiens (Human)	308	structural molecule activity [GO:0005198]	FUNCTION: The coatomer is a cytosolic protein complex that binds to dilysine motifs and reversibly associates with Golgi non-clathrin-coated vesicles, which further mediate biosynthetic protein transport from the ER, via the Golgi up to the trans Golgi network. The coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. In mammals, the coatomer can only be recruited by membranes associated with ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small GTP-binding proteins; the complex also influences the Golgi structural integrity, as well as the processing, activity, and endocytic recycling of LDL receptors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Voltage sensing is coupled to K(+) electrochemical gradient in an 'ion flux gating' mode where outward but not inward ion flow opens the gate (PubMed:23169818, PubMed:26919430, PubMed:32499642, PubMed:36195757, PubMed:9312005). Changes ion selectivity and becomes permeable to Na(+) ions in response to extracellular acidification. Protonation of the pH sensor His-98 stabilizes C-type inactivation conformation likely converting the channel from outward K(+)-conducting, to inward Na(+)-conducting to nonconductive state (PubMed:22948150). Homo- and heterodimerizes to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties (PubMed:23169818, PubMed:32499642). Allows K(+) currents with fast-gating kinetics important for the repolarization and hyperpolarization phases of action potentials (By similarity). In cerebellar granule cells, heteromeric KCNK3:KCNK9 channel may hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential to limit intrinsic neuronal excitability, but once the action potential threshold is reached, it may support high-frequency action potential firing and increased neuronal excitability (By similarity). Dispensable for central chemosensory respiration i.e. breathing controlled by brainstem CO2/pH, it rather conducts pH-sensitive currents and controls the firing rate of serotonergic raphe neurons involved in potentiation of the respiratory chemoreflex. Additionally, imparts chemosensitivity to type 1 cells in carotid bodies which respond to a decrease in arterial oxygen pressure or an increase in carbon dioxide pressure or pH to initiate adaptive changes in pulmonary ventilation (By similarity). In adrenal gland, contributes to the maintenance of a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential of aldosterone-producing cells at zona glomerulosa and limits aldosterone release as part of a regulatory mechanism that controls arterial blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis (By similarity). In brown adipocytes, mediates K(+) efflux that counteracts norepinephrine-induced membrane depolarization, limits Ca(2+) efflux and downstream cAMP and PKA signaling, ultimately attenuating lipid oxidation and adaptive thermogenesis (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35111, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54912, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22948150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23169818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26919430, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32499642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36195757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9312005}.

Plays an essential role in migrasome formation and migration on retracting fibers at the rear end of migrating cells (PubMed:31371828). Migrasomes are cellular organelles that form as large vesicle-like structures on retraction fibers of migrating cells (PubMed:31371828). Mechanistically, acts as a membrane curvature sensor and participates in stabilizing the migrasome structure in a late stage of biogenesis (PubMed:36252000, PubMed:36823145).

This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Inhibits the transactivation function of HIF-1A under both normoxic and hypoxia-mimicking conditions. The interaction with EMAP2 increases the proteasome-mediated HIF-1A degradation under the hypoxic conditions. Plays a role in hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Mediates nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR) and thereby enhances androgen-mediated transactivation. Promotes MAVS degradation and thereby negatively regulates MAVS-mediated innate immune response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11389899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11713272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12119296, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15244466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19442227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19734229, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8610016}.

Fatty acid binding increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and may also enhance the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). May also play a role in bone homeostasis; receptor signaling activates pathways that inhibit osteoclast differentiation (By similarity). Ligand binding leads to a conformation change that triggers signaling via G-proteins that activate phospholipase C, leading to an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration. Seems to act through a G(q) and G(i)-mediated pathway. Mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q76JU9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12496284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17699519, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23809162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24130766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24742677}.

O14843	FFAR3_HUMAN	Free fatty acid receptor 3 (G-protein coupled receptor 41)	Homo sapiens (Human)	346	G protein-coupled receptor activity [GO:0004930]; lipid binding [GO:0008289]	FUNCTION: G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by a major product of dietary fiber digestion, the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and that plays a role in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis and in intestinal immunity. In omnivorous mammals, the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate are produced primarily by the gut microbiome that metabolizes dietary fibers. SCFAs serve as a source of energy but also act as signaling molecules. That G protein-coupled receptor is probably coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive, G(i/o)-alpha family of G proteins. Its activation results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the phosphorylation of the MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2 kinases and the inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation (PubMed:12711604). Activated by SCFAs and by beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body produced by the liver upon starvation, it inhibits N-type calcium channels and modulates the activity of sympathetic neurons through a signaling cascade involving the beta and gamma subunits of its coupled G protein, phospholipase C and MAP kinases. Thereby, it may regulate energy expenditure through the control of the sympathetic nervous system that controls for instance heart rate. Upon activation by SCFAs accumulating in the intestine, it may also signal to the brain via neural circuits which in turn would regulate intestinal gluconeogenesis. May also control the production of hormones involved in whole-body energy homeostasis. May for instance, regulate blood pressure through renin secretion. May also regulate secretion of the PYY peptide by enteroendocrine cells and control gut motility, intestinal transit rate, and the harvesting of energy from SCFAs produced by gut microbiota. May also indirectly regulate the production of LEP/Leptin, a hormone acting on the CNS to inhibit food intake, in response to the presence of short-chain fatty acids in the intestine. Finally, may also play a role in glucose homeostasis. Besides its role in energy homeostasis, may play a role in intestinal immunity. May mediate the activation of the inflammatory and immune response by SCFAs in the gut, regulating the rapid production of chemokines and cytokines by intestinal epithelial cells. Among SCFAs, the fatty acids containing less than 6 carbons, the most potent activators are probably propionate, butyrate and pentanoate while acetate is a poor activator (PubMed:12496283, PubMed:12711604). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12496283, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12711604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18801738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23066016}.

O14862	AIM2_HUMAN	Interferon-inducible protein AIM2 (Absent in melanoma 2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	343	cysteine-type endopeptidase activator activity [GO:0140608]; double-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003690]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; pattern recognition receptor activity [GO:0038187]; signaling adaptor activity [GO:0035591]	FUNCTION: Sensor component of the AIM2 inflammasome, which mediates inflammasome activation in response to the presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol, leading to subsequent pyroptosis (PubMed:17726700, PubMed:19158675, PubMed:19158676, PubMed:19158679, PubMed:20566831, PubMed:23530044, PubMed:26197926, PubMed:26583071, PubMed:29440442, PubMed:33980849, PubMed:37364111). Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation (PubMed:17726700, PubMed:19158675, PubMed:19158676, PubMed:19158679, PubMed:20566831, PubMed:26197926, PubMed:29440442, PubMed:33980849). Acts as a recognition receptor (PRR): specifically recognizes and binds dsDNA in the cytosol, and mediates the formation of the inflammasome polymeric complex composed of AIM2, CASP1 and PYCARD/ASC (PubMed:17726700, PubMed:19158675, PubMed:19158676, PubMed:19158679, PubMed:20566831, PubMed:26197926, PubMed:29440442, PubMed:33980849). Recruitment of pro-caspase-1 (proCASP1) to the AIM2 inflammasome promotes caspase-1 (CASP1) activation, which subsequently cleaves and activates inflammatory cytokines IL1B and IL18 and gasdermin-D (GSDMD), promoting cytokine secretion (PubMed:17726700, PubMed:19158675, PubMed:19158676, PubMed:19158679, PubMed:20566831). In some cells, CASP1 activation mediates cleavage and activation of GSDMD, triggering pyroptosis without promoting cytokine secretion (PubMed:19158675, PubMed:19158676). Detects cytosolic dsDNA of viral and bacterial origin in a non-sequence-specific manner (PubMed:17726700, PubMed:19158675, PubMed:19158676, PubMed:19158679, PubMed:20566831, PubMed:26197926, PubMed:26583071, PubMed:29440442, PubMed:33980849). Involved in the DNA damage response caused by acute ionizing radiation by mediating pyroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks (By similarity). Mechanistically, AIM2 senses DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome assembly and inflammatory cell death (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of neurodevelopment via its role in the DNA damage response: acts by promoting neural cell death in response to DNA damage in the developing brain, thereby purging genetically compromised cells of the central nervous system (By similarity). Pyroptosis mediated by the AIM2 inflammasome in response to DNA damage is dependent on GSDMD without involving IL1B and IL18 cytokine secretion (By similarity). Also acts as a mediator of pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis (PANoptosis), an integral part of host defense against pathogens, in response to bacterial infection (By similarity). Can also trigger PYCARD/ASC-dependent, caspase-1-independent cell death that involves caspase-8 (CASP8) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q91VJ1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19158675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19158676, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19158679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20566831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23530044, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26197926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26583071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29440442, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33980849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37364111}.; FUNCTION: Also acts as a tumor suppressor independently of its role in inflammatory response (PubMed:16432157). Able to suppress overt cell proliferation in enterocytes: restricts stem cell proliferation in the intestinal mucosa in an inflammasome-independent manner, contributing to a decrease in the likelihood of colorectal cancer development (By similarity). AIM2 suppresses cell proliferation by inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT1 at 'Ser-473', preventing AKT1 activation and AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (By similarity). Inhibits AKT1 phosphorylation both by inhibiting the activity of PRKDC/DNA-PK kinase and promoting dephosphorylation by PP2A phosphatase (By similarity). Also acts as a key regulator of regulatory T-cells (Treg) homeostasis by promoting their stability: acts by preventing AKT1 activation (By similarity). Its role in Treg homeostasis is important to restain autoimmune diseases (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q91VJ1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16432157}.	AIM2
O14893	GEMI2_HUMAN	Gem-associated protein 2 (Gemin-2) (Component of gems 2) (Survival of motor neuron protein-interacting protein 1) (SMN-interacting protein 1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	280		FUNCTION: The SMN complex catalyzes the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome, and thereby plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs (PubMed:18984161, PubMed:9323129). Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core) (PubMed:18984161). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG (5Sm) are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:18984161). To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A (PubMed:18984161, PubMed:9323129). Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm ultimately triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:31799625). Within the SMN complex, GEMIN2 constrains the conformation of 5Sm, thereby promoting 5Sm binding to snRNA containing the snRNP code (a nonameric Sm site and a 3'-adjacent stem-loop), thus preventing progression of assembly until a cognate substrate is bound (PubMed:16314521, PubMed:21816274, PubMed:31799625). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21816274, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31799625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9323129}.

The BCDX2 complex was originally reported to bind single-stranded DNA, single-stranded gaps in duplex DNA and specifically to nicks in duplex DNA. The BCDX2 subcomplex RAD51B:RAD51C exhibits single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity suggesting an involvement in early stages of the HR pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11751635, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11751636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11842113, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12441335, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23108668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23149936}.

O15318	RPC7_HUMAN	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC7 (RNA polymerase III subunit C7) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit G) (RNA polymerase III 32 kDa apha subunit) (RPC32-alpha) (RNA polymerase III 32 kDa subunit) (RPC32)	Homo sapiens (Human)	223	chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; DNA-directed 5'-3' RNA polymerase activity [GO:0003899]	FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:34675218, PubMed:35637192). Specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci (PubMed:20154270, PubMed:20413673, PubMed:35637192). Acts as a long tether that bridges POLR3C/RPC3-POLR3F/RPC6-POLR3G/RPC7 heterotrimer and the mobile stalk of Pol III, coordinating the dynamics of Pol III stalk and clamp modules during the transition from apo to elongation state. Pol III exists as two alternative complexes defined by the mutually exclusive incorporation of subunit POLR3G/RPC7alpha or POLR3GL/RPC7beta. POLR3G/RPC7alpha modulates Pol III transcriptome by specifically enhancing the transcription of snaR-A non-coding RNAs. At resting state, occupies the active site of apo Pol III and keeps Pol III in an autoinhibitory mode, preventing non-specific transcription (PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766, PubMed:35637192). Pol III plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses. Acts as a nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune response. Can sense non-self dsDNA that serves as template for transcription into dsRNA. The non-self RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs), induce type I interferon and NF-kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:19631370). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19609254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19631370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20154270, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20413673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33558764, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33558766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34675218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35637192}.

In omnivorous mammals, the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate are produced primarily by the gut microbiome that metabolizes dietary fibers. SCFAs serve as a source of energy but also act as signaling molecules. That G protein-coupled receptor is probably coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive, G(i/o)-alpha family of G proteins but also to the Gq family (PubMed:12496283, PubMed:12711604, PubMed:23589301). Its activation results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the phosphorylation of the MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2 kinases and the inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation. May play a role in glucose homeostasis by regulating the secretion of GLP-1, in response to short-chain fatty acids accumulating in the intestine. May also regulate the production of LEP/Leptin, a hormone acting on the central nervous system to inhibit food intake. Finally, may also regulate whole-body energy homeostasis through adipogenesis regulating both differentiation and lipid storage of adipocytes. In parallel to its role in energy homeostasis, may also mediate the activation of the inflammatory and immune responses by SCFA in the intestine, regulating the rapid production of chemokines and cytokines. May also play a role in the resolution of the inflammatory response and control chemotaxis in neutrophils. In addition to SCFAs, may also be activated by the extracellular lectin FCN1 in a process leading to activation of monocytes and inducing the secretion of interleukin-8/IL-8 in response to the presence of microbes (PubMed:21037097).

Able to inhibit lipid droplet size in adipocytes. Following incorporation into mature adipocytes via CD36-mediated endocytosis, associates with cytosolic FASN, inhibiting fatty acid synthase activity and leading to lipolysis, the degradation of triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA). CD5L-induced lipolysis occurs with progression of obesity: participates in obesity-associated inflammation following recruitment of inflammatory macrophages into adipose tissues, a cause of insulin resistance and obesity-related metabolic disease. Regulation of intracellular lipids mediated by CD5L has a direct effect on transcription regulation mediated by nuclear receptors ROR-gamma (RORC). Acts as a key regulator of metabolic switch in T-helper Th17 cells. Regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Th17 cells by altering the lipid content and limiting synthesis of cholesterol ligand of RORC, the master transcription factor of Th17-cell differentiation. CD5L is mainly present in non-pathogenic Th17 cells, where it decreases the content of polyunsaturated fatty acyls (PUFA), affecting two metabolic proteins MSMO1 and CYP51A1, which synthesize ligands of RORC, limiting RORC activity and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Participates in obesity-associated autoimmunity via its association with IgM, interfering with the binding of IgM to Fcalpha/mu receptor and enhancing the development of long-lived plasma cells that produce high-affinity IgG autoantibodies (By similarity).

Navs, also called VGSCs (voltage-gated sodium channels) or VDSCs (voltage-dependent sodium channels), operate by switching between closed and open conformations depending on the voltage difference across the membrane. In the open conformation they allow Na(+) ions to selectively pass through the pore, along their electrochemical gradient. The influx of Na+ ions provokes membrane depolarization, initiating the propagation of electrical signals throughout cells and tissues (PubMed:19808477, PubMed:23559163, PubMed:26894959).

O75177	CREST_HUMAN	Calcium-responsive transactivator (SS18-like protein 1) (SYT homolog 1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	396	transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713]	FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which is required for calcium-dependent dendritic growth and branching in cortical neurons. Recruits CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) to nuclear bodies. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

In addition, mediates the hydrogen peroxide release from hepatocyte mitochondria that modulates the SREBF2-mediated cholesterol synthesis and facilitates the mitochondrial ammonia uptake which is metabolized into urea, mainly under glucagon stimulation (PubMed:30579780, PubMed:34292591). In B cells, transports the CYBB-generated hydrogen peroxide from the external leaflet of the plasma membrane to the cytosol to promote B cell activation and differentiation for signal amplification (By similarity). In the small intestine and colon system, mediates water transport through mitochondria and apical membrane of epithelial cells (By similarity). May play an important role in the adaptive response of proximal tubule cells to acidosis possibly by facilitating the mitochondrial ammonia transport (PubMed:22622463). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P56404, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P56405, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15948717, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18948439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22622463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23541115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29732408, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30579780, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34292591}.

During forebrain development represses WNT1 expression allowing zona limitans intrathalamica formation and thereby ensuring proper anterio-posterior patterning of the diencephalon and formation of the rostral diencephalon. Acts as a direct upstream activator of SHH expression in the rostral diencephalon ventral midline and that in turn SHH maintains its expression. In addition, Six3 activity is required for the formation of the telencephalon. During postnatal stages of brain development is necessary for ependymal cell maturation by promoting the maturation of radial glia into ependymal cells through regulation of neuroblast proliferation and migration. Acts on the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells through activating transcription of CCND1 and CCND2. During early lens formation plays a role in lens induction and specification by activating directly PAX6 in the presumptive lens ectoderm. In turn PAX6 activates SIX3 resulting in activation of PDGFRA and CCND1 promoting cell proliferation. Also is required for the neuroretina development by directly suppressing WNT8B expression in the anterior neural plate territory. Its action during retina development and lens morphogenesis is TLE5 and TLE4-dependent manner. Furthermore, during eye development regulates several genes expression. Before and during early lens development represses the CRYGF promoter by binding a SIX repressor element. Directly activates RHO transcription, or cooperates with CRX or NRL. Six3 functions also in the formation of the proximodistal axis of the optic cup, and promotes the formation of optic vesicles-like structures. During pituitary development, acts in parallel or alternatively with HESX1 to control cell proliferation through Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (By similarity).

Binds to 3 E-boxes of the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene promoter and to the promoters of CLDN7 and KRT8 and, in association with histone demethylase KDM1A which it recruits to the promoters, causes a decrease in dimethylated H3K4 levels and represses transcription (PubMed:10655587, PubMed:20389281, PubMed:20562920). The N-terminal SNAG domain competes with histone H3 for the same binding site on the histone demethylase complex formed by KDM1A and RCOR1, and thereby inhibits demethylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-4' (in vitro) (PubMed:20389281, PubMed:21300290, PubMed:23721412). During EMT, involved with LOXL2 in negatively regulating pericentromeric heterochromatin transcription (PubMed:16096638). SNAI1 recruits LOXL2 to pericentromeric regions to oxidize histone H3 and repress transcription which leads to release of heterochromatin component CBX5/HP1A, enabling chromatin reorganization and acquisition of mesenchymal traits (By similarity). Associates with EGR1 and SP1 to mediate tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)-induced up-regulation of CDKN2B, possibly by binding to the CDKN2B promoter region 5'-TCACA-3 (PubMed:20121949).

Plays a key role in cell positioning and movement in lymphoid tissues: 25-hydroxycholesterol is an intermediate in biosynthesis of 7-alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7-alpha,25-OHC), an oxysterol that acts as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR183/EBI2, a chemotactic receptor for a number of lymphoid cells (By similarity). May play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism by synthesizing a corepressor that blocks sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) processing (PubMed:9852097). As an interferon-stimulated gene, has broad antiviral activities against a wide range of enveloped viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, activates the ER-localized enzyme ACAT to induce internalization of accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane and restricts SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated fusion which inhibits virus replication (PubMed:32944968, PubMed:33239446). In testis, production of 25-hydroxycholesterol by macrophages plays a role in Leydig cell differentiation (By similarity). Required to restrain inflammation in macrophages: production of 25-hydroxycholesterol protects macrophages from cholesterol overload, thereby preventing mitochondrial DNA release and subsequent activation of the AIM2 inflammasome (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q4QQV7, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0F5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32944968, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33239446, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9852097}.

Probably acts by blocking the action of key proteins. During the mitosis, it blocks Separase/ESPL1 function, preventing the proteolysis of the cohesin complex and the subsequent segregation of the chromosomes. At the onset of anaphase, it is ubiquitinated, conducting to its destruction and to the liberation of ESPL1. Its function is however not limited to a blocking activity, since it is required to activate ESPL1. Negatively regulates the transcriptional activity and related apoptosis activity of TP53. The negative regulation of TP53 may explain the strong transforming capability of the protein when it is overexpressed. May also play a role in DNA repair via its interaction with Ku, possibly by connecting DNA damage-response pathways with sister chromatid separation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10411507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11238996, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11371342, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12355087}.

Associates non-covalently with TGF-beta-1 and regulates its activation via interaction with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1, LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS, that control activation of TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:19651619, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:2022183, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931). Interaction with LRRC33/NRROS regulates activation of TGF-beta-1 in macrophages and microglia (Probable). Interaction with LRRC32/GARP controls activation of TGF-beta-1 on the surface of activated regulatory T-cells (Tregs) (PubMed:19651619, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742). Interaction with integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8) results in distortion of the Latency-associated peptide chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19651619, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19750484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2022183, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22278742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28117447, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8617200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939931, ECO:0000305|PubMed:29909984}.; FUNCTION: [Transforming growth factor beta-1]: Multifunctional protein that regulates the growth and differentiation of various cell types and is involved in various processes, such as normal development, immune function, microglia function and responses to neurodegeneration (By similarity). Activation into mature form follows different steps: following cleavage of the proprotein in the Golgi apparatus, Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) chains remain non-covalently linked rendering TGF-beta-1 inactive during storage in extracellular matrix (PubMed:29109152). At the same time, LAP chain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1, LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS that control activation of TGF-beta-1 and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellular milieus (PubMed:19651619, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:2022183, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931). TGF-beta-1 is released from LAP by integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8): integrin-binding to LAP stabilizes an alternative conformation of the LAP bowtie tail and results in distortion of the LAP chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-1 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), which transduce signal (PubMed:20207738). While expressed by many cells types, TGF-beta-1 only has a very localized range of action within cell environment thanks to fine regulation of its activation by Latency-associated peptide chain (LAP) and 'milieu molecules' (By similarity). Plays an important role in bone remodeling: acts as a potent stimulator of osteoblastic bone formation, causing chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiation in committed osteoblasts (By similarity). Can promote either T-helper 17 cells (Th17) or regulatory T-cells (Treg) lineage differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner (By similarity). At high concentrations, leads to FOXP3-mediated suppression of RORC and down-regulation of IL-17 expression, favoring Treg cell development (By similarity). At low concentrations in concert with IL-6 and IL-21, leads to expression of the IL-17 and IL-23 receptors, favoring differentiation to Th17 cells (By similarity). Stimulates sustained production of collagen through the activation of CREB3L1 by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (PubMed:25310401). Mediates SMAD2/3 activation by inducing its phosphorylation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:29483653, PubMed:30696809). Positively regulates odontoblastic differentiation in dental papilla cells, via promotion of IPO7-mediated translocation of phosphorylated SMAD2 to the nucleus and subsequent transcription of target genes (By similarity). Can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in various cell types (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:30696809). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19651619, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19750484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20207738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2022183, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22278742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25310401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25893292, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28117447, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29109152, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29483653, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30696809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8617200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939931}.

After binding to its receptor IL1R1 together with its accessory protein IL1RAP, forms the high affinity interleukin-1 receptor complex (PubMed:17507369, PubMed:2950091). Signaling involves the recruitment of adapter molecules such as MYD88, IRAK1 or IRAK4 (PubMed:17507369). In turn, mediates the activation of NF-kappa-B and the three MAPK pathways p38, p42/p44 and JNK pathways (PubMed:14687581). Within the cell, acts as an alarmin and cell death results in its liberation in the extracellular space after disruption of the cell membrane to induce inflammation and alert the host to injury or damage (PubMed:15679580).

In T-cells, functions primarily as a coreceptor for MHC class I molecule:peptide complex. The antigens presented by class I peptides are derived from cytosolic proteins while class II derived from extracellular proteins. Interacts simultaneously with the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the MHC class I proteins presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs). In turn, recruits the Src kinase LCK to the vicinity of the TCR-CD3 complex. LCK then initiates different intracellular signaling pathways by phosphorylating various substrates ultimately leading to lymphokine production, motility, adhesion and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This mechanism enables CTLs to recognize and eliminate infected cells and tumor cells. In NK-cells, the presence of CD8A homodimers at the cell surface provides a survival mechanism allowing conjugation and lysis of multiple target cells. CD8A homodimer molecules also promote the survival and differentiation of activated lymphocytes into memory CD8 T-cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16236125, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17678538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23657257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26082771}.

In complex with the beta chain HLA-DRB, displays antigenic peptides on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) for recognition by alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on HLA-DR-restricted CD4-positive T cells. This guides antigen-specific T-helper effector functions, both antibody-mediated immune response and macrophage activation, to ultimately eliminate the infectious agents and transformed cells (PubMed:15265931, PubMed:15322540, PubMed:17334368, PubMed:22327072, PubMed:24190431, PubMed:27591323, PubMed:29884618, PubMed:31495665, PubMed:8145819, PubMed:9075930). Typically presents extracellular peptide antigens of 10 to 30 amino acids that arise from proteolysis of endocytosed antigens in lysosomes (PubMed:8145819). In the tumor microenvironment, presents antigenic peptides that are primarily generated in tumor-resident APCs likely via phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells or macropinocytosis of secreted tumor proteins (PubMed:31495665). Presents peptides derived from intracellular proteins that are trapped in autolysosomes after macroautophagy, a mechanism especially relevant for T cell selection in the thymus and central immune tolerance (PubMed:17182262, PubMed:23783831). The selection of the immunodominant epitopes follows two processing modes: 'bind first, cut/trim later' for pathogen-derived antigenic peptides and 'cut first, bind later' for autoantigens/self-peptides (PubMed:25413013).

The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22407913}.

P01920	DQB1_HUMAN	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DQ beta 1 chain (MHC class II antigen DQB1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	261	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; MHC class II receptor activity [GO:0032395]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading.

APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles (PubMed:12950167, PubMed:1530612, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:20030366, PubMed:20303980, PubMed:2063194, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:7768901, PubMed:8756331, PubMed:8939961). Finally, APOE has also a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells (PubMed:23676495, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:9395455, PubMed:9488694). A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23676495, PubMed:29516132, PubMed:9395455). APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis (PubMed:1917954, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:9395455). First, it is functionally associated with ABCA1 in the biogenesis of HDLs in tissues (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513). Second, it is enriched in circulating HDLs and mediates their uptake by hepatocytes (PubMed:9395455). APOE also plays an important role in lipid transport in the central nervous system, regulating neuron survival and sprouting (PubMed:25173806, PubMed:8939961). APOE is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, controlling for instance the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity). Binds to the immune cell receptor LILRB4 (PubMed:30333625). APOE may also play a role in transcription regulation through a receptor-dependent and cholesterol-independent mechanism, that activates MAP3K12 and a non-canonical MAPK signal transduction pathway that results in enhanced AP-1-mediated transcription of APP (PubMed:28111074). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08226, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12950167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14754908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1530612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1911868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917954, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20030366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20303980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2063194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2762297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28111074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30333625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6860692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7635945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7768901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8756331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8939961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9395455, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488694, ECO:0000303|PubMed:25173806, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29516132}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Through its interaction with HCV envelope glycoprotein E2, participates in the attachment of HCV to HSPGs and other receptors (LDLr, VLDLr, and SR-B1) on the cell surface and to the assembly, maturation and infectivity of HCV viral particles (PubMed:25122793, PubMed:29695434).

P04440	DPB1_HUMAN	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DP beta 1 chain (HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DP(W4) beta chain) (MHC class II antigen DPB1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	258	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading.

Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

P05089	ARGI1_HUMAN	Arginase-1 (EC 3.5.3.1) (Liver-type arginase) (Type I arginase)	Homo sapiens (Human)	322	arginase activity [GO:0004053]; manganese ion binding [GO:0030145]	FUNCTION: Key element of the urea cycle converting L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine, which is further metabolized into metabolites proline and polyamides that drive collagen synthesis and bioenergetic pathways critical for cell proliferation, respectively; the urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys. {ECO:0000305}.; FUNCTION: Functions in L-arginine homeostasis in nonhepatic tissues characterized by the competition between nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase for the available intracellular substrate arginine. Arginine metabolism is a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses. Involved in an antimicrobial effector pathway in polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). Upon PMN cell death is liberated from the phagolysosome and depletes arginine in the microenvironment leading to suppressed T cell and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation and cytokine secretion (PubMed:15546957, PubMed:16709924, PubMed:19380772). In group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) promotes acute type 2 inflammation in the lung and is involved in optimal ILC2 proliferation but not survival (By similarity). In humans, the immunological role in the monocytic/macrophage/dendritic cell (DC) lineage is unsure. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q61176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15546957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16709924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19380772}.

Cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and the matrix-open state (m-state): operates by the alternating access mechanism with a single substrate-binding site intermittently exposed to either the cytosolic (c-state) or matrix (m-state) side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (By similarity). In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (By similarity). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A5/ANT2 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Probably mediates mitochondrial uncoupling in tissues that do not express UCP1 (By similarity). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (PubMed:31883789). It is however unclear if SLC25A5/ANT2 constitutes a pore-forming component of mPTP or regulates it (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of mitophagy independently of ADP:ATP antiporter activity: promotes mitophagy via interaction with TIMM44, leading to inhibit the presequence translocase TIMM23, thereby promoting stabilization of PINK1 (By similarity). As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it may play a role in chromosome segregation (PubMed:20797633). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G2QNH0, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P51881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31883789}.

P05198	IF2A_HUMAN	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha) (eIF-2-alpha) (eIF-2A) (eIF-2alpha) (eIF2-alpha)	Homo sapiens (Human)	315	ribosome binding [GO:0043022]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]; translation initiation factor activity [GO:0003743]	FUNCTION: Member of the eIF2 complex that functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA (PubMed:16289705, PubMed:38340717). This complex binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by mRNA binding to form a 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC) (PubMed:16289705). Junction of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex is preceded by hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2 and release of an eIF2-GDP binary complex (PubMed:16289705). In order for eIF2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF2 must exchange with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by eIF2B (PubMed:16289705). EIF2S1/eIF2-alpha is a key component of the integrated stress response (ISR), required for adaptation to various stress: phosphorylation by metabolic-stress sensing protein kinases (EIF2AK1/HRI, EIF2AK2/PKR, EIF2AK3/PERK and EIF2AK4/GCN2) in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to an attenuation of cap-dependent translation, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activators ATF4 and QRICH1, and hence allowing ATF4- and QRICH1-mediated reprogramming (PubMed:19131336, PubMed:33384352, PubMed:38340717). EIF2S1/eIF2-alpha also acts as an activator of mitophagy in response to mitochondrial damage: phosphorylation by EIF2AK1/HRI promotes relocalization to the mitochondrial surface, thereby triggering PRKN-independent mitophagy (PubMed:38340717). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16289705, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19131336, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33384352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:38340717}.

Binds to IL6R, then the complex associates to the signaling subunit IL6ST/gp130 to trigger the intracellular IL6-signaling pathway (Probable). The interaction with the membrane-bound IL6R and IL6ST stimulates 'classic signaling', whereas the binding of IL6 and soluble IL6R to IL6ST stimulates 'trans-signaling'. Alternatively, 'cluster signaling' occurs when membrane-bound IL6:IL6R complexes on transmitter cells activate IL6ST receptors on neighboring receiver cells (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:30995492}.; FUNCTION: IL6 is a potent inducer of the acute phase response. Rapid production of IL6 contributes to host defense during infection and tissue injury, but excessive IL6 synthesis is involved in disease pathology. In the innate immune response, is synthesized by myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, upon recognition of pathogens through toll-like receptors (TLRs) at the site of infection or tissue injury (Probable). In the adaptive immune response, is required for the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Plays a major role in the differentiation of CD4(+) T cell subsets. Essential factor for the development of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells that are required for the induction of germinal-center formation. Required to drive naive CD4(+) T cells to the Th17 lineage. Also required for proliferation of myeloma cells and the survival of plasmablast cells (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08505, ECO:0000305|PubMed:30995492}.; FUNCTION: Acts as an essential factor in bone homeostasis and on vessels directly or indirectly by induction of VEGF, resulting in increased angiogenesis activity and vascular permeability (PubMed:12794819, PubMed:17075861). Induces, through 'trans-signaling' and synergistically with IL1B and TNF, the production of VEGF (PubMed:12794819). Involved in metabolic controls, is discharged into the bloodstream after muscle contraction increasing lipolysis and improving insulin resistance (PubMed:20823453). 'Trans-signaling' in central nervous system also regulates energy and glucose homeostasis (By similarity). Mediates, through GLP-1, crosstalk between insulin-sensitive tissues, intestinal L cells and pancreatic islets to adapt to changes in insulin demand (By similarity). Also acts as a myokine (Probable). Plays a protective role during liver injury, being required for maintenance of tissue regeneration (By similarity). Also has a pivotal role in iron metabolism by regulating HAMP/hepcidin expression upon inflammation or bacterial infection (PubMed:15124018). Through activation of IL6ST-YAP-NOTCH pathway, induces inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12794819, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15124018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17075861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20823453, ECO:0000305|PubMed:30995492}.

Heterodimerizes with proteins of the FOS family to form an AP-1 transcription complex, thereby enhancing its DNA binding activity to the AP-1 consensus sequence 5'-TGA[GC]TCA-3' and enhancing its transcriptional activity (By similarity). Together with FOSB, plays a role in activation-induced cell death of T cells by binding to the AP-1 promoter site of FASLG/CD95L, and inducing its transcription in response to activation of the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway (PubMed:12618758).

Specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci. Assembles with POLR3E/RPC5 forming a subcomplex that binds the Pol III core.

P05538	DQB2_HUMAN	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DQ beta 2 chain (HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DX beta chain) (MHC class II antigen DQB2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	268	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; MHC class II receptor activity [GO:0032395]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22407913}.

CDK1/CDC2-cyclin-B controls pronuclear union in interphase fertilized eggs (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Essential for early stages of embryonic development (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). During G2 and early mitosis, CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation activates CDK1/cyclin complexes which phosphorylate several substrates that trigger at least centrosome separation, Golgi dynamics, nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007, PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:30139873). Once chromosomes are condensed and aligned at the metaphase plate, CDK1 activity is switched off by WEE1- and PKMYT1-mediated phosphorylation to allow sister chromatid separation, chromosome decondensation, reformation of the nuclear envelope and cytokinesis (PubMed:18480403, PubMed:20360007). Phosphorylates KRT5 during prometaphase and metaphase (By similarity). Inactivated by PKR/EIF2AK2- and WEE1-mediated phosphorylation upon DNA damage to stop cell cycle and genome replication at the G2 checkpoint thus facilitating DNA repair (PubMed:20360007). Reactivated after successful DNA repair through WIP1-dependent signaling leading to CDC25A/B/C-mediated dephosphorylation and restoring cell cycle progression (PubMed:20395957). Catalyzes lamin (LMNA, LMNB1 and LMNB2) phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis, promoting nuclear envelope breakdown (PubMed:2188730, PubMed:2344612, PubMed:37788673). In proliferating cells, CDK1-mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation at the G2-M phase represses FOXO1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and thereby promotes FOXO1 nuclear accumulation and transcription factor activity, leading to cell death of postmitotic neurons (PubMed:18356527). The phosphorylation of beta-tubulins regulates microtubule dynamics during mitosis (PubMed:16371510). NEDD1 phosphorylation promotes PLK1-mediated NEDD1 phosphorylation and subsequent targeting of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to the centrosome, an important step for spindle formation (PubMed:19509060). In addition, CC2D1A phosphorylation regulates CC2D1A spindle pole localization and association with SCC1/RAD21 and centriole cohesion during mitosis (PubMed:20171170). The phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/BCL2L1 after prolongated G2 arrest upon DNA damage triggers apoptosis (PubMed:19917720). In contrast, CASP8 phosphorylation during mitosis prevents its activation by proteolysis and subsequent apoptosis (PubMed:20937773). This phosphorylation occurs in cancer cell lines, as well as in primary breast tissues and lymphocytes (PubMed:20937773). EZH2 phosphorylation promotes H3K27me3 maintenance and epigenetic gene silencing (PubMed:20935635). CALD1 phosphorylation promotes Schwann cell migration during peripheral nerve regeneration (By similarity). CDK1-cyclin-B complex phosphorylates NCKAP5L and mediates its dissociation from centrosomes during mitosis (PubMed:26549230). Regulates the amplitude of the cyclic expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 by phosphorylating its transcriptional repressor NR1D1, and this phosphorylation is necessary for SCF(FBXW7)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NR1D1 (PubMed:27238018). Phosphorylates EML3 at 'Thr-881' which is essential for its interaction with HAUS augmin-like complex and TUBG1 (PubMed:30723163). Phosphorylates CGAS during mitosis, leading to its inhibition, thereby preventing CGAS activation by self DNA during mitosis (PubMed:32351706). Phosphorylates SKA3 on multiple sites during mitosis which promotes SKA3 binding to the NDC80 complex and anchoring of the SKA complex to kinetochores, to enable stable attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochores (PubMed:28479321, PubMed:31804178, PubMed:32491969). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P11440, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P39951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16371510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407259, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16933150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17459720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18356527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18480403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19202191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19509060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19917720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20171170, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20360007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20935635, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20937773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21063390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2188730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23355470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2344612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23601106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23602554, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25556658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26549230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26829474, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27238018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27814491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28479321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30139873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30704899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30723163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31804178, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32351706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32491969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34741373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37788673}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes and facilitates its cell entry. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21516087}.

Component of the protein complex eIF4F, which is involved in the recognition of the mRNA cap, ATP-dependent unwinding of 5'-terminal secondary structure and recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome (By similarity). This protein recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine (m7G)-containing mRNA cap during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the unwinding of the mRNAs secondary structures (PubMed:16271312, PubMed:22578813). Together with EIF4G1, antagonizes the scanning promoted by EIF1-EIF4G1 and is required for TISU translation, a process where the TISU element recognition makes scanning unnecessary (PubMed:29987188). In addition to its role in translation initiation, also acts as a regulator of translation and stability in the cytoplasm (PubMed:24335285). Component of the CYFIP1-EIF4E-FMR1 complex which binds to the mRNA cap and mediates translational repression: in the complex, EIF4E mediates the binding to the mRNA cap (By similarity). Component of a multiprotein complex that sequesters and represses translation of proneurogenic factors during neurogenesis (By similarity). In P-bodies, component of a complex that mediates the storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in the cytoplasm and prevents their degradation (PubMed:24335285). May play an important role in spermatogenesis through translational regulation of stage-specific mRNAs during germ cell development (By similarity). As well as its roles in translation, also involved in mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport (By similarity). Its role in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm relies on its ability to bind the m7G cap of RNAs and on the presence of the 50-nucleotide EIF4E sensitivity element (4ESE) in the 3'UTR of sensitive transcripts (By similarity). Interaction with the 4ESE is mediated by LRPPRC which binds simultaneously to both EIF4E and the 4ESE, thereby acting as a platform for assembly for the RNA export complex (By similarity). EIF4E-dependent mRNA export is independent of ongoing protein or RNA synthesis and is also NFX1-independent but is XPO1-dependent with LRPPRC interacting with XPO1 to form an EIF4E-dependent mRNA export complex (By similarity). Alters the composition of the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore to promote RNA export by reducing RANBP2 expression, relocalizing nucleoporin NUP214 and increasing expression of RANBP1 and RNA export factors DDX19 and GLE1 (By similarity). Promotes the nuclear export of cyclin CCND1 mRNA (By similarity). Promotes the nuclear export of NOS2/iNOS mRNA (PubMed:23471078). Promotes the nuclear export of MDM2 mRNA (PubMed:22684010). Promotes the export of additional mRNAs, including others involved in the cell cycle (By similarity). In the nucleus, binds to capped splice factor-encoding mRNAs and stimulates their nuclear export to enhance splice factor production by increasing their cytoplasmic availability to the translation machinery (By similarity). May also regulate splicing through interaction with the spliceosome in an RNA and m7G cap-dependent manner (By similarity). Also binds to some pre-mRNAs and may play a role in their recruitment to the spliceosome (By similarity). Promotes steady-state capping of a subset of coding and non-coding RNAs by mediating nuclear export of capping machinery mRNAs including RNMT, RNGTT and RAMAC to enhance their translation (By similarity). Stimulates mRNA 3'-end processing by promoting the expression of several core cleavage complex factors required for mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, and may also have a direct effect through its interaction with the CPSF3 cleavage enzyme (By similarity). Rescues cells from apoptosis by promoting activation of serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT1 through mRNA export of NBS1 which potentiates AKT1 phosphorylation and also through mRNA export of AKT1 effectors, allowing for increased production of these proteins (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63073, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11606200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16271312, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22578813, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22684010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23471078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24335285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29987188}.

When antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), TCR-mediated signals are transmitted across the cell membrane by the CD3 chains CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD3Z. All CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. Upon TCR engagement, these motifs become phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases LCK and FYN, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:2470098). In addition of this role of signal transduction in T-cell activation, CD3E plays an essential role in correct T-cell development. Initiates the TCR-CD3 complex assembly by forming the two heterodimers CD3D/CD3E and CD3G/CD3E. Participates also in internalization and cell surface down-regulation of TCR-CD3 complexes via endocytosis sequences present in CD3E cytosolic region (PubMed:10384095, PubMed:26507128). In addition to its role as a TCR coreceptor, it serves as a receptor for ITPRIPL1. Ligand recognition inhibits T-cell activation by promoting interaction with NCK1, which prevents CD3E-ZAP70 interaction and blocks the ERK-NFkB signaling cascade and calcium influx (PubMed:38614099). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10384095, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12110186, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15294938, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15546002, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2470098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26507128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:38614099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8490660}.

Binding to class A CpG activates cytokine production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells implicating TLR9, MYD88 and AGER/RAGE and can activate autoreactive B cells. Via HMGB1-containing chromatin immune complexes may also promote B cell responses to endogenous TLR9 ligands through a B-cell receptor (BCR)-dependent and ACER/RAGE-independent mechanism (By similarity). Inhibits phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages; the function is dependent on poly-ADP-ribosylation and involves binding to phosphatidylserine on the cell surface of apoptotic cells (By similarity).

Endopeptidase that cleaves histones N-terminal tails at the carboxyl side of methylated arginine or lysine residues, to generate 'tailless nucleosomes', which may trigger transcription elongation (PubMed:28847961). Preferentially recognizes and cleaves monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues of histones H2, H3 and H4 (PubMed:28847961). After initial cleavage, continues to digest histones tails via its aminopeptidase activity (PubMed:28847961). Additionally, may play a role in protein biosynthesis by modifying the translation machinery (PubMed:29915238). Acts as a Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent monooxygenase, catalyzing (S)-stereospecific hydroxylation at C-3 of 'Lys-22' of DRG1 and 'Lys-21' of DRG2 translation factors (TRAFAC), promoting their interaction with ribonucleic acids (RNA) (PubMed:29915238). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28847961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29915238}.

When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34239127, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19754430}.

Exerts its oncogenic activity through: the regulation of MYC transcriptional activity, the regulation of cell cycle progression and by phosphorylation and inhibition of proapoptotic proteins (BAD, MAP3K5, FOXO3) (PubMed:18593906). Phosphorylation of MYC leads to an increase of MYC protein stability and thereby an increase of transcriptional activity (By similarity). The stabilization of MYC exerted by PIM1 might explain partly the strong synergism between these two oncogenes in tumorigenesis (By similarity). Mediates survival signaling through phosphorylation of BAD, which induces release of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L)/BCL2L1 (By similarity). Phosphorylation of MAP3K5, another proapoptotic protein, by PIM1, significantly decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity and inhibits MAP3K5-mediated phosphorylation of JNK and JNK/p38MAPK subsequently reducing caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis (PubMed:19749799). Stimulates cell cycle progression at the G1-S and G2-M transitions by phosphorylation of CDC25A and CDC25C (PubMed:16356754). Phosphorylation of CDKN1A, a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1, results in the relocation of CDKN1A to the cytoplasm and enhanced CDKN1A protein stability (PubMed:12431783). Promotes cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis by down-regulating expression of a regulator of cell cycle progression, CDKN1B, at both transcriptional and post-translational levels (PubMed:18593906). Phosphorylation of CDKN1B, induces 14-3-3 proteins binding, nuclear export and proteasome-dependent degradation (PubMed:18593906). May affect the structure or silencing of chromatin by phosphorylating HP1 gamma/CBX3 (PubMed:10664448).

Acts as a positive regulator of mTORC1 signaling by mediating phosphorylation and inhibition of DEPDC5 component of the GATOR1 complex (PubMed:31548394). Acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity by mediating phosphorylation and inactivation of GBP1 in absence of infection: phosphorylation of GBP1 induces interaction with 14-3-3 protein sigma (SFN) and retention in the cytosol (PubMed:37797010). Also phosphorylates and activates the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2, allowing resistance to drugs through their excretion from cells (PubMed:18056989).

Cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and the matrix-open state (m-state): operates by the alternating access mechanism with a single substrate-binding site intermittently exposed to either the cytosolic (c-state) or matrix (m-state) side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (By similarity). In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (PubMed:31883789). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A4/ANT1 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (PubMed:31883789).

Induces cartilage and bone formation (PubMed:3201241). Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2 (PubMed:15064755, PubMed:17295905, PubMed:18436533). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, BMPR2 phosphorylates and activates BMPR1A (PubMed:7791754). In turn, BMPR1A propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes. Also acts to promote expression of HAMP, via the interaction with its receptor BMPR1A/ALK3 (PubMed:31800957). Can also signal through non-canonical pathways such as ERK/MAP kinase signaling cascade that regulates osteoblast differentiation (PubMed:16771708, PubMed:20851880). Also stimulates the differentiation of myoblasts into osteoblasts via the EIF2AK3-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway by stimulating EIF2A phosphorylation which leads to increased expression of ATF4 which plays a central role in osteoblast differentiation (PubMed:24362451). Acts as a positive regulator of odontoblast differentiation during mesenchymal tooth germ formation, expression is repressed during the bell stage by MSX1-mediated inhibition of CTNNB1 signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21274, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064755, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17295905, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18436533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20851880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24362451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31019025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31800957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3201241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7791754}.

In complex with B2M/beta-2-microglobulin binds nonamer self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class Ia molecules (VL9 peptides - VMAPRT[V/L][L/V/I/F]L) (PubMed:18083576, PubMed:18339401, PubMed:35705051, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9754572). Peptide-bound HLA-E-B2M heterotrimeric complex primarily functions as a ligand for natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory receptor KLRD1-KLRC1, enabling NK cells to monitor the expression of other MHC class I molecules in healthy cells and to tolerate self (PubMed:17179229, PubMed:18083576, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9486650, PubMed:9754572). Upon cellular stress, preferentially binds signal sequence-derived peptides from stress-induced chaperones and is no longer recognized by NK cell inhibitory receptor KLRD1-KLRC1, resulting in impaired protection from NK cells (PubMed:12461076). Binds signal sequence-derived peptides from non-classical MHC class Ib HLA-G molecules and acts as a ligand for NK cell activating receptor KLRD1-KLRC2, likely playing a role in the generation and effector functions of adaptive NK cells and in maternal-fetal tolerance during pregnancy (PubMed:30134159, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9754572). Besides self-peptides, can also bind and present pathogen-derived peptides conformationally similar to VL9 peptides to alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on unconventional CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells, ultimately triggering antimicrobial immune response (PubMed:16474394, PubMed:20195504, PubMed:30087334, PubMed:34228645). Presents HIV gag peptides (immunodominant KAFSPEVIPMF and subdominant KALGPAATL epitopes) predominantly to CD8-positive T cell clones expressing a TRAV17-containing TCR, triggering HLA-E-restricted T cell responses (PubMed:34228645).

P13762	DRB4_HUMAN	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR beta 4 chain (MHC class II antigen DRB4)	Homo sapiens (Human)	266	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading.

It prevents their reannealing and in parallel, recruits and activates different proteins and complexes involved in DNA metabolism. Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage. In the cellular response to DNA damage, the RPA complex controls DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Through recruitment of ATRIP activates the ATR kinase a master regulator of the DNA damage response. It is required for the recruitment of the DNA double-strand break repair factors RAD51 and RAD52 to chromatin in response to DNA damage. Also recruits to sites of DNA damage proteins like XPA and XPG that are involved in nucleotide excision repair and is required for this mechanism of DNA repair.

Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:31023583, PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:31023583, PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707).

However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Activates the expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1 downstream of the EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response, thereby promoting formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes and increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (PubMed:31023583). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352).

Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity).

P20036	DPA1_HUMAN	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DP alpha 1 chain (DP(W3)) (DP(W4)) (HLA-SB alpha chain) (MHC class II DP3-alpha) (MHC class II DPA1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	260	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; MHC class II receptor activity [GO:0032395]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading.

This complex binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by mRNA binding to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). Junction of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex is preceded by hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2 and release of an eIF2-GDP binary complex. In order for eIF2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF2 must exchange with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by eIF2B (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05198, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31836389}.

The TFIID complex structure can be divided into 3 modules TFIID-A, TFIID-B, and TFIID-C (PubMed:33795473). TBP forms the TFIID-A module together with TAF3 and TAF5 (PubMed:33795473). TBP is a general transcription factor that functions at the core of the TFIID complex (PubMed:2194289, PubMed:2363050, PubMed:2374612, PubMed:27193682, PubMed:33795473, PubMed:9836642). During assembly of the core PIC on the promoter, as part of TFIID, TBP binds to and also bends promoter DNA, irrespective of whether the promoter contains a TATA box (PubMed:33795473). Component of a BRF2-containing transcription factor complex that regulates transcription mediated by RNA polymerase III (PubMed:26638071). Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIF-IB complex, which is involved in the assembly of the PIC during RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription (PubMed:15970593). The rate of PIC formation probably is primarily dependent on the rate of association of SL1 with the rDNA promoter (PubMed:15970593). SL1 is involved in stabilization of nucleolar transcription factor 1/UBTF on rDNA (PubMed:15970593). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15970593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2194289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2363050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2374612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26638071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27007846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27193682, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33795473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9836642}.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DEPTOR, FRS2 or GRB10) (PubMed:35216969). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10393181, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10617468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12110590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12356731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12974390, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15788397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15952796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19265199, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34497368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35216969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8325880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9155018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9480836}.

The two major activities of APEX1 are DNA repair and redox regulation of transcriptional factors. Functions as an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endodeoxyribonuclease in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway of DNA lesions induced by oxidative and alkylating agents. Initiates repair of AP sites in DNA by catalyzing hydrolytic incision of the phosphodiester backbone immediately adjacent to the damage, generating a single-strand break with 5'-deoxyribose phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl ends. Also incises at AP sites in the DNA strand of DNA/RNA hybrids, single-stranded DNA regions of R-loop structures, and single-stranded RNA molecules. Has 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity on mismatched deoxyribonucleotides at the 3' termini of nicked or gapped DNA molecules during short-patch BER. Possesses DNA 3' phosphodiesterase activity capable of removing lesions (such as phosphoglycolate) blocking the 3' side of DNA strand breaks. May also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by participating in DNA demethylation. Acts as a loading factor for POLB onto non-incised AP sites in DNA and stimulates the 5'-terminal deoxyribose 5'-phosphate (dRp) excision activity of POLB. Plays a role in protection from granzyme-mediated cellular repair leading to cell death. Also involved in the DNA cleavage step of class switch recombination (CSR). On the other hand, APEX1 also exerts reversible nuclear redox activity to regulate DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity of transcriptional factors by controlling the redox status of their DNA-binding domain, such as the FOS/JUN AP-1 complex after exposure to IR. Involved in calcium-dependent down-regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) expression by binding to negative calcium response elements (nCaREs). Together with HNRNPL or the dimer XRCC5/XRCC6, associates with nCaRE, acting as an activator of transcriptional repression. Stimulates the YBX1-mediated MDR1 promoter activity, when acetylated at Lys-6 and Lys-7, leading to drug resistance. Acts also as an endoribonuclease involved in the control of single-stranded RNA metabolism. Plays a role in regulating MYC mRNA turnover by preferentially cleaving in between UA and CA dinucleotides of the MYC coding region determinant (CRD). In association with NMD1, plays a role in the rRNA quality control process during cell cycle progression. Associates, together with YBX1, on the MDR1 promoter. Together with NPM1, associates with rRNA.

This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Within the 20S core complex, PSMB5 displays a chymotrypsin-like activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15244466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18502982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18565852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8610016}.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade.

Participates in the corticosteroid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory response, as well as metabolic and homeostatic processes (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:12414862, PubMed:15152005, PubMed:21453287). Plays a role in the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye, maintaining a normotensive, intraocular environment (PubMed:11481269). Bidirectional in vitro, predominantly functions as a reductase in vivo, thereby increasing the concentration of active glucocorticoids (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:11481269, PubMed:12414862, PubMed:12460758). It has broad substrate specificity, besides glucocorticoids, it accepts other steroid and sterol substrates (PubMed:15095019, PubMed:15152005, PubMed:17593962, PubMed:21453287). Interconverts 7-oxo- and 7-hydroxy-neurosteroids such as 7-oxopregnenolone and 7beta-hydroxypregnenolone, 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone (3beta-hydroxy-5-androstene-7,17-dione) and 7beta-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone (3beta,7beta-dihydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one), among others (PubMed:17593962). Catalyzes the stereo-specific conversion of the major dietary oxysterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7-oxocholesterol), into the more polar 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol metabolite (PubMed:15095019, PubMed:15152005). 7-oxocholesterol is one of the most important oxysterols, it participates in several events such as induction of apoptosis, accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions, lipid peroxidation, and induction of foam cell formation (PubMed:15095019). Mediates the 7-oxo reduction of 7-oxolithocholate mainly to chenodeoxycholate, and to a lesser extent to ursodeoxycholate, both in its free form and when conjugated to glycine or taurine, providing a link between glucocorticoid activation and bile acid metabolism (PubMed:21453287). Catalyzes the synthesis of 7-beta-25-dihydroxycholesterol from 7-oxo-25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro, which acts as a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) and may thereby regulate immune cell migration (PubMed:30902677). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10497248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12460758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14973125, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15095019, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15152005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17593962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21453287, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27927697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30902677, ECO:0000303|PubMed:10497248, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11481269, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12414862, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12460758, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15095019, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15152005, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21453287}.

IL-12 is primarily produced by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as well as macrophages and granulocytes and regulates T-cell and natural killer-cell responses, induces the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), favors the differentiation of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and is an important link between innate resistance and adaptive immunity (PubMed:1673147, PubMed:1674604, PubMed:8605935). Mechanistically, exerts its biological effects through a receptor composed of IL12R1 and IL12R2 subunits (PubMed:8943050). Binding to the receptor results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular substrates including the JAK family kinases TYK2 and JAK2 (PubMed:7528775). In turn, recruited STAT4 gets phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates cytokine/growth factor responsive genes (PubMed:7638186). As part of IL-35, plays essential roles in maintaining the immune homeostasis of the liver microenvironment and functions also as an immune-suppressive cytokine (By similarity). Mediates biological events through unconventional receptors composed of IL12RB2 and gp130/IL6ST heterodimers or homodimers (PubMed:22306691).

The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:31073061). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:31073061). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:31073061). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:31073061). Signaling is mediated via phospholipase C-beta-dependent inositol lipid hydrolysis for signal propagation: activates phospholipase C-beta: following GPCR activation, GNA11 activates PLC-beta (PLCB1, PLCB2, PLCB3 or PLCB4), leading to production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (PubMed:31073061). Transduces FFAR4 signaling in response to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (PubMed:27852822). Together with GNAQ, required for heart development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27852822, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31073061}.	GNA11 GA11

Can reduce H(2)O(2) and short chain organic, fatty acid, and phospholipid hydroperoxides (PubMed:10893423). Also has phospholipase activity, can therefore either reduce the oxidized sn-2 fatty acyl group of phospholipids (peroxidase activity) or hydrolyze the sn-2 ester bond of phospholipids (phospholipase activity) (PubMed:10893423, PubMed:26830860). These activities are dependent on binding to phospholipids at acidic pH and to oxidized phospholipds at cytosolic pH (PubMed:10893423). Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides and in phospholipid homeostasis (PubMed:10893423). Exhibits acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase which mediates the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or LPC) into phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or PC) (PubMed:26830860).

Promotes fetal heme degradation during development (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Also expressed in adult tissues, where it acts as a regulator of hematopoiesis, intermediary metabolism (glutaminolysis, glycolysis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway) and insulin signaling (PubMed:27207795, PubMed:29500232, PubMed:38056462). Has a broad specificity oxidoreductase activity by catalyzing the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of a variety of flavins, such as riboflavin, FAD or FMN, biliverdins, methemoglobin and PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone) (PubMed:10620517, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Contributes to fetal heme catabolism by catalyzing reduction of biliverdin IXbeta into bilirubin IXbeta in the liver (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Biliverdin IXbeta, which constitutes the major heme catabolite in the fetus is not present in adult (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Does not reduce bilirubin IXalpha (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Can also reduce the complexed Fe(3+) iron to Fe(2+) in the presence of FMN and NADPH (PubMed:10620517). Acts as a protein nitrosyltransferase by catalyzing nitrosylation of cysteine residues of target proteins, such as HMOX2, INSR and IRS1 (PubMed:38056462). S-nitroso-CoA-dependent nitrosyltransferase activity is mediated via a 'ping-pong' mechanism: BLVRB first associates with both S-nitroso-CoA and protein substrate, nitric oxide group is then transferred from S-nitroso-CoA to Cys-109 and Cys-188 residues of BLVRB and from S-nitroso-BLVRB to the protein substrate (PubMed:38056462).

Also activated by enkephalin peptides, such as Met-enkephalin or Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, with higher affinity for Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (By similarity). Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors (PubMed:7905839). The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extent to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15 (PubMed:12068084). They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B (By similarity). Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins (By similarity). The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4 (By similarity). Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization (By similarity). Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction (By similarity). The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins (By similarity). The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation (By similarity). Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling (By similarity). Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling (By similarity). Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling (By similarity). Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P33535, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10529478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12589820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7891175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7905839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7957926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9689128, ECO:0000303|PubMed:10836142, ECO:0000303|PubMed:19300905}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 12]: Couples to GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20525224}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 16]: Does not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16580639}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 17]: Does not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16580639}.

Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K7/MKK7, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The phosphorylation of the Thr residue by MAP2K7/MKK7 seems to be the prerequisite for JNK activation at least in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, while other stimuli activate both MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 which synergistically phosphorylate JNKs. MAP2K4 is required for maintaining peripheral lymphoid homeostasis. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Whereas MAP2K7/MKK7 exclusively activates JNKs, MAP2K4/MKK4 additionally activates the p38 MAPKs MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7716521}.

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:19061985, PubMed:23636399, PubMed:24120868). It also couples ribosome biogenesis to p53/TP53 activation.

The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. The cytochrome b-c1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this redox reaction to translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, with protons being carried across the membrane as hydrogens on the quinol. In the process called Q cycle, 2 protons are consumed from the matrix, 4 protons are released into the intermembrane space and 2 electrons are passed to cytochrome c. The Rieske protein is a catalytic core subunit containing a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster.

Also indirectly activates the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes (PubMed:23516580, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:7797510). Acts as a thiol protease that cleaves a tetrapeptide after an Asp residue at position P1: catalyzes cleavage of CGAS, GSDMD and IL18 (PubMed:15326478, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:28314590, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714, PubMed:7797510). Effector of the non-canonical inflammasome independently of NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP1: the non-canonical inflammasome promotes pyroptosis through GSDMD cleavage without involving secretion of cytokine IL1B (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:31268602, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). In the non-canonical inflammasome, CASP4 is activated by direct binding to the lipid A moiety of LPS without the need of an upstream sensor (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:25121752, PubMed:29520027, PubMed:32510692, PubMed:32581219, PubMed:37993712). LPS-binding promotes CASP4 activation and CASP4-mediated cleavage of GSDMD and IL18, followed by IL18 secretion through the GSDMD pore, pyroptosis of infected cells and their extrusion into the gut lumen (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:25121752, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). Also indirectly promotes secretion of mature cytokines (IL1A and HMGB1) downstream of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis via activation of the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes (PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412). Involved in NLRP3-dependent CASP1 activation and IL1B secretion in response to non-canonical activators, such as UVB radiation or cholera enterotoxin (PubMed:22246630, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:24879791, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:26173988, PubMed:26174085, PubMed:26508369). Involved in NLRP6 inflammasome-dependent activation in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, which leads to CASP1 activation and IL1B secretion (PubMed:33377178). Involved in LPS-induced IL6 secretion; this activity may not require caspase enzymatic activity (PubMed:26508369). The non-canonical inflammasome is required for innate immunity to cytosolic, but not vacuolar, bacteria (By similarity). Plays a crucial role in the restriction of S.typhimurium replication in colonic epithelial cells during infection (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:25964352). Activation of the non-canonical inflammasome in brain endothelial cells can lead to excessive pyroptosis, leading to blood-brain barrier breakdown (By similarity). Pyroptosis limits bacterial replication, while cytokine secretion promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells and triggers mucosal inflammation (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:26375003). May also act as an activator of adaptive immunity in dendritic cells, following activation by oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, an oxidized phospholipid (oxPAPC) (By similarity). Involved in cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and by treatment with cytotoxic APP peptides found in Alzheimer's patient brains (PubMed:15123740, PubMed:22246630, PubMed:23661706). Cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32109412). Catalyzes cleavage and maturation of IL18; IL18 processing also depends of the exosite interface on CASP4 (PubMed:15326478, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). In contrast, it does not directly process IL1B (PubMed:7743998, PubMed:7797510, PubMed:7797592). During non-canonical inflammasome activation, cuts CGAS and may play a role in the regulation of antiviral innate immune activation (PubMed:28314590). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P70343, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15123740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15326478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22246630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23516580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23661706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24879791, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25119034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25121752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25964352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26173988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26174085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26375003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26508369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28314590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29520027, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31268602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32109412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32510692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32581219, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33377178, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34671164, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37001519, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37993714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7743998, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7797510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7797592}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In response to the Td92 surface protein of the periodontal pathogen T.denticola, activated by cathepsin CTSG which leads to production and secretion of IL1A and pyroptosis of gingival fibroblasts. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29077095}.

Binds directly to the consensus DNA sequence 5'-T[TG]NNGNAA[TG]-3' acting as an activator on distinct target genes (PubMed:11242107). During early embryogenesis, plays essential and redundant functions with CEBPB. Essential for the transition from common myeloid progenitors (CMP) to granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP). Critical for the proper development of the liver and the lung (By similarity). Necessary for terminal adipocyte differentiation, is required for postnatal maintenance of systemic energy homeostasis and lipid storage (By similarity). To regulate these different processes at the proper moment and tissue, interplays with other transcription factors and modulators. Down-regulates the expression of genes that maintain cells in an undifferentiated and proliferative state through E2F1 repression, which is critical for its ability to induce adipocyte and granulocyte terminal differentiation. Reciprocally E2F1 blocks adipocyte differentiation by binding to specific promoters and repressing CEBPA binding to its target gene promoters. Proliferation arrest also depends on a functional binding to SWI/SNF complex (PubMed:14660596). In liver, regulates gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis through different mechanisms. To regulate gluconeogenesis, functionally cooperates with FOXO1 binding to IRE-controlled promoters and regulating the expression of target genes such as PCK1 or G6PC1. To modulate lipogenesis, interacts and transcriptionally synergizes with SREBF1 in promoter activation of specific lipogenic target genes such as ACAS2.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated by the binding to a cyclin and mediate the progression through the cell cycle. Each different complex controls a specific transition between 2 subsequent phases in the cell cycle. Required for both activation and complex formation of CDK1/cyclin-B during G2-M transition, and for activation of CDK2/cyclins during G1-S transition (but not complex formation). CDK7 is the catalytic subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex. Phosphorylates SPT5/SUPT5H, SF1/NR5A1, POLR2A, p53/TP53, CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and CDK11B/CDK11. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 by threonine phosphorylation, thus regulating cell cycle progression. CAK complexed to the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor activates RNA polymerase II by serine phosphorylation of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of its large subunit (POLR2A), allowing its escape from the promoter and elongation of the transcripts (PubMed:9852112). Phosphorylation of POLR2A in complex with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Its expression and activity are constant throughout the cell cycle. Upon DNA damage, triggers p53/TP53 activation by phosphorylation, but is inactivated in turn by p53/TP53; this feedback loop may lead to an arrest of the cell cycle and of the transcription, helping in cell recovery, or to apoptosis.

With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes.

MAPK12 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in myoblast differentiation and also in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 in response to hypoxia in adrenal cells suggesting MAPK12 may inhibit cell proliferation while promoting differentiation. Phosphorylates DLG1. Following osmotic shock, MAPK12 in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear DLG1, thereby causing dissociation of DLG1-SFPQ complexes. This function is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid cell adaptation to osmolarity changes in the environment. Regulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling and repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 arrest after gamma-radiation exposure. MAPK12 is involved in the regulation of SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes; and negatively regulates SLC2A4 expression and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. C-Jun (JUN) phosphorylation is stimulated by MAPK14 and inhibited by MAPK12, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. MAPK12 is required for the normal kinetochore localization of PLK1, prevents chromosomal instability and supports mitotic cell viability. MAPK12-signaling is also positively regulating the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14592936, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17724032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20605917, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21172807, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8633070, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9430721}.

Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it (PubMed:8995301). Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages (PubMed:8995301). The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. Can be blocked by extracellular barium and cesium (PubMed:8995301). In the kidney, together with KCNJ16, mediates basolateral K(+) recycling in distal tubules; this process is critical for Na(+) reabsorption at the tubules (PubMed:24561201). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P49655, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8995301, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24561201}.

In fetal dendritic cells may play a role in promoting immune suppression and T cell TNF-alpha production during gestation (PubMed:28614294). Regulates RPS6KB1 signaling, which promotes endothelial cell senescence and inflammation and implicates NOS3/eNOS dysfunction (PubMed:22928666). Can inhibit endothelial autophagy independently of its enzymatic activity implicating mTORC2 signaling (PubMed:25484082). Involved in vascular smooth muscle cell senescence and apoptosis independently of its enzymatic activity (PubMed:23832324). Since NOS is found in the penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, the clitoral corpus cavernosum and the vagina, arginase-2 plays a role in both male and female sexual arousal (PubMed:12859189). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12859189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22928666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23832324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25484082, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27214549, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27745970}.

In response to interferon IFN-alpha, associates in a complex with signaling pathway regulator NMI to regulate immune response; the complex formation prevents proteasome-mediated degradation of IFI35 and correlates with IFI35 dephosphorylation (PubMed:10779520, PubMed:10950963). In complex with NMI, inhibits virus-triggered type I interferon/IFN-beta production (PubMed:26342464). In complex with NMI, negatively regulates nuclear factor NF-kappa-B signaling by inhibiting the nuclear translocation, activation and transcription of the NF-kappa-B subunit p65/RELA, resulting in the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, migration and re-endothelialization of injured arteries (PubMed:29350881). Beside its role as an intracellular signaling pathway regulator, also functions extracellularly as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to promote inflammation when actively released by macrophage to the extracellular space during cell injury and pathogen invasion (PubMed:29038465). Macrophage-secreted IFI35 activates NF-kappa-B signaling in adjacent macrophages through Toll-like receptor 4/TLR4 activation, thereby inducing NF-kappa-B translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus which promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:29038465). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10779520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10950963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26342464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29038465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29350881}.

In the process, potentiates the antiprotease function of I-alpha-I complex through release of free bikunin (PubMed:15917224, PubMed:16873769, PubMed:20463016). Acts as a catalyst in the formation of hyaluronan-HC oligomers and hyaluronan-rich matrix surrounding the cumulus cell-oocyte complex, a necessary step for oocyte fertilization (PubMed:26468290). Assembles hyaluronan in pericellular matrices that serve as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling. Enables binding of hyaluronan deposited on the surface of macrophages to LYVE1 on lymphatic endothelium and facilitates macrophage extravasation. Alters hyaluronan binding to functionally latent CD44 on vascular endothelium, switching CD44 into an active state that supports leukocyte rolling (PubMed:15060082, PubMed:26823460). Modulates the interaction of chemokines with extracellular matrix components and proteoglycans on endothelial cell surface, likely preventing chemokine gradient formation (PubMed:27044744). In a negative feedback mechanism, may limit excessive neutrophil recruitment at inflammatory sites by antagonizing the association of CXCL8 with glycosaminoglycans on vascular endothelium (PubMed:24501198). Has a role in osteogenesis and bone remodeling. Inhibits BMP2-dependent differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblasts (PubMed:16771708, PubMed:18586671).

Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Negatively regulates the CACNA1B/CAV2.2 -mediated Ca(2+) release probability at hippocampal neuronal soma and synaptic terminals (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in postmitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and/or spine morphogenesis. Phosphorylates also exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma-dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. May regulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via the modulation of lamellipodia formation. Involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by mediating the EFNA1-EPHA4 signaling. The complex p35/CDK5 participates in the regulation of the circadian clock by modulating the function of CLOCK protein: phosphorylates CLOCK at 'Thr-451' and 'Thr-461' and regulates the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer in association with altered stability and subcellular distribution. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12393264, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12691662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15992363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17009320, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17121855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17591690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17671990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18042622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19081376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19693690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20061803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20213743, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20826806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21209322, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21220307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21442427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21465480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21499257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24235147, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822744}.

Is a key enzyme in the polyol pathway that interconverts glucose and fructose via sorbitol, which constitutes an important alternate route for glucose metabolism. The polyol pathway is believed to be involved in the etiology of diabetic complications, such as diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy, induced by hyperglycemia (PubMed:12962626, PubMed:25105142, PubMed:29966615). May play a role in sperm motility by using sorbitol as an alternative energy source for sperm motility (PubMed:16278369).

Q01105	SET_HUMAN	Protein SET (HLA-DR-associated protein II) (Inhibitor of granzyme A-activated DNase) (IGAAD) (PHAPII) (Phosphatase 2A inhibitor I2PP2A) (I-2PP2A) (Template-activating factor I) (TAF-I)	Homo sapiens (Human)	290	chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; histone binding [GO:0042393]; protein phosphatase inhibitor activity [GO:0004864]; protein phosphatase regulator activity [GO:0019888]	FUNCTION: Multitasking protein, involved in apoptosis, transcription, nucleosome assembly and histone chaperoning. Isoform 2 anti-apoptotic activity is mediated by inhibition of the GZMA-activated DNase, NME1. In the course of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced apoptosis, GZMA cleaves SET, disrupting its binding to NME1 and releasing NME1 inhibition. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 inhibit EP300/CREBBP and PCAF-mediated acetylation of histones (HAT) and nucleosomes, most probably by masking the accessibility of lysines of histones to the acetylases. The predominant target for inhibition is histone H4. HAT inhibition leads to silencing of HAT-dependent transcription and prevents active demethylation of DNA. Both isoforms stimulate DNA replication of the adenovirus genome complexed with viral core proteins; however, isoform 2 specific activity is higher. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12628186}.

Binding of extracellular ligands such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones to their cell-surface receptors activates RAS and this initiates RAF1 activation. RAF1 then further activates the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Both MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2 function specifically in the MAPK/ERK cascade, and catalyze the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2, leading to their activation and further transduction of the signal within the MAPK/ERK cascade. Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126). Depending on the cellular context, this pathway mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation, predominantly through the regulation of transcription, metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangements. One target of the MAPK/ERK cascade is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that promotes differentiation and apoptosis. MAP2K1/MEK1 has been shown to export PPARG from the nucleus. The MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC), as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14737111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29433126}.

This ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex plays important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, in cellular antiviral activities and inhibition of tumor formation. The BAF complex is able to create a stable, altered form of chromatin that constrains fewer negative supercoils than normal. This change in supercoiling would be due to the conversion of up to one-half of the nucleosomes on polynucleosomal arrays into asymmetric structures, termed altosomes, each composed of 2 histones octamers. Stimulates in vitro the remodeling activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A. Involved in activation of CSF1 promoter. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity).

Q13287	NMI_HUMAN	N-myc-interactor (Nmi) (N-myc and STAT interactor)	Homo sapiens (Human)	307	identical protein binding [GO:0042802]	FUNCTION: Acts as a signaling pathway regulator involved in innate immune system response (PubMed:26342464, PubMed:29038465, PubMed:29350881, PubMed:9989503). In response to interleukin 2/IL2 and interferon IFN-gamma/IFNG, interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription/STAT which activate the transcription of downstream genes involved in a multitude of signals for development and homeostasis (PubMed:29377960, PubMed:9989503). Enhances the recruitment of CBP/p300 coactivators to STAT1 and STAT5, resulting in increased STAT1- and STAT5-dependent transcription (PubMed:9989503). In response to interferon IFN-alpha, associates in a complex with signaling pathway regulator IFI35 to regulate immune response; the complex formation prevents proteasome-mediated degradation of IFI35 (PubMed:10779520, PubMed:10950963). In complex with IFI35, inhibits virus-triggered type I IFN-beta production when ubiquitinated by ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 (PubMed:26342464). In complex with IFI35, negatively regulates nuclear factor NF-kappa-B signaling by inhibiting the nuclear translocation, activation and transcription of NF-kappa-B subunit p65/RELA, resulting in the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, migration and re-endothelialization of injured arteries (PubMed:29350881). Negatively regulates virus-triggered type I interferon/IFN production by inducing proteosome-dependent degradation of IRF7, a transcriptional regulator of type I IFN, thereby interfering with cellular antiviral responses (By similarity). Beside its role as an intracellular signaling pathway regulator, also functions extracellularly as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to promote inflammation, when actively released by macrophage to the extracellular space during cell injury or pathogen invasion (PubMed:29038465). Macrophage-secreted NMI activates NF-kappa-B signaling in adjacent macrophages through Toll-like receptor 4/TLR4 binding and activation, thereby inducing NF-kappa-B translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus which promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:29038465). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10779520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10950963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26342464, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29038465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29350881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9989503}.

Q13291	SLAF1_HUMAN	Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (CDw150) (IPO-3) (SLAM family member 1) (CD antigen CD150)	Homo sapiens (Human)	335	antigen binding [GO:0003823]; cell adhesion mediator activity [GO:0098631]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; SH2 domain binding [GO:0042169]; signaling receptor activity [GO:0038023]; transmembrane signaling receptor activity [GO:0004888]; virus receptor activity [GO:0001618]	FUNCTION: Self-ligand receptor of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family. SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. SLAMF1-induced signal-transduction events in T-lymphocytes are different from those in B-cells. Two modes of SLAMF1 signaling seem to exist: one depending on SH2D1A (and perhaps SH2D1B) and another in which protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2C (PTPN11)-dependent signal transduction operates. Initially it has been proposed that association with SH2D1A prevents binding to inhibitory effectors including INPP5D/SHIP1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:11806999). However, signaling is also regulated by SH2D1A which can simultaneously interact with and recruit FYN which subsequently phosphorylates and activates SLAMF1 (PubMed:12458214). Mediates IL-2-independent proliferation of activated T-cells during immune responses and induces IFN-gamma production (By similarity). Downstreaming signaling involves INPP5D, DOK1 and DOK2 leading to inhibited IFN-gamma production in T-cells, and PRKCQ, BCL10 and NFKB1 leading to increased T-cell activation and Th2 cytokine production (By similarity). Promotes T-cell receptor-induced IL-4 secretion by CD4(+) cells (By similarity). Inhibits antigen receptor-mediated production of IFN-gamma, but not IL-2, in CD4(-)/CD8(-) T-cells (By similarity). Required for IL-4 production by germinal centers T follicular helper (T(Fh))cells (By similarity). May inhibit CD40-induced signal transduction in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (PubMed:16317102). May play a role in allergic responses and may regulate allergen-induced Th2 cytokine and Th1 cytokine secretion (By similarity). In conjunction with SLAMF6 controls the transition between positive selection and the subsequent expansion and differentiation of the thymocytic natural killer T (NKT) cell lineage. Involved in the peripheral differentiation of indifferent natural killer T (iNKT) cells toward a regulatory NKT2 type (By similarity). In macrophages involved in down-regulation of IL-12, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (By similarity). In B-cells activates the ERK signaling pathway independently of SH2D1A but implicating both, SYK and INPP5D, and activates Akt signaling dependent on SYK and SH2D1A (By similarity). In B-cells also activates p38 MAPK and JNK1 and JNK2 (PubMed:20231852). In conjunction with CD84/SLAMF5 and SLAMF6 may be a negative regulator of the humoral immune response (By similarity). Involved in innate immune response against Gram-negative bacteria in macrophages; probably recognizes OmpC and/or OmpF on the bacterial surface, regulates phagosome maturation and recruitment of the PI3K complex II (PI3KC3-C2) leading to accumulation of PdtIns(3)P and NOX2 activity in the phagosomes (PubMed:20818396). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QUM4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317102, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20231852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20818396, ECO:0000305|PubMed:11806999, ECO:0000305|PubMed:12458214}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Measles virus; also including isoform 4. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10972291, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21217702}.

Requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate and iron (PubMed:18603530, PubMed:27497299). A number of activities have been described for this dioxygenase, but recent results suggest that it mainly acts as on tRNAs and mediates their demethylation or oxidation depending on the context and subcellular compartment (PubMed:27497299, PubMed:27745969). Mainly acts as a tRNA demethylase by removing N(1)-methyladenine from various tRNAs, with a preference for N(1)-methyladenine at position 58 (m1A58) present on a stem loop structure of tRNAs (PubMed:27745969). Acts as a regulator of translation initiation and elongation in response to glucose deprivation: regulates both translation initiation, by mediating demethylation of tRNA(Met), and translation elongation, N(1)-methyladenine-containing tRNAs being preferentially recruited to polysomes to promote translation elongation (PubMed:27745969). In mitochondrion, specifically interacts with mt-tRNA(Met) and mediates oxidation of mt-tRNA(Met) methylated at cytosine(34) to form 5-formylcytosine (f(5)c) at this position (PubMed:27497299). mt-tRNA(Met) containing the f(5)c modification at the wobble position enables recognition of the AUA codon in addition to the AUG codon, expanding codon recognition in mitochondrial translation (PubMed:27497299). Specifically demethylates DNA methylated on the 6th position of adenine (N(6)-methyladenosine) DNA (PubMed:30017583, PubMed:30392959). N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) DNA is present at some L1 elements in embryonic stem cells and probably promotes their silencing (By similarity). Demethylates mRNAs containing N(3)-methylcytidine modification (PubMed:31188562). Also able to repair alkylated single-stranded DNA by oxidative demethylation, but with low activity (PubMed:18603530). Also has DNA lyase activity and introduces double-stranded breaks at abasic sites: cleaves both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA at abasic sites, with the greatest activity towards double-stranded DNA with two abasic sites (PubMed:19959401). DNA lyase activity does not require alpha-ketboglutarate and iron and leads to the formation of an irreversible covalent protein-DNA adduct with the 5' DNA product (PubMed:19959401, PubMed:23577621). DNA lyase activity is not required during base excision repair and class switch recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy chain during B lymphocyte activation.

Binds to nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from the ribosome and blocks their interaction with the signal recognition particle (SRP), which normally targets nascent secretory peptides to the ER. Also reduces the inherent affinity of ribosomes for protein translocation sites in the ER membrane (M sites). May act as a specific coactivator for JUN, binding to DNA and stabilizing the interaction of JUN homodimers with target gene promoters. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10982809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15784678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9877153}.

Can catalyze the reverse reaction but at a much lower rate in vitro (PubMed:16640564). HMG-CoA is then quickly degraded by another enzyme (such as HMG-CoA lyase) to give acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate (PubMed:16640564). Uses other substrates such as (2E)-glutaconyl-CoA efficiently in vitro, and to a lesser extent 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA (3-methyl-(2E)-butenoyl-CoA), crotonyl-CoA ((2E)-butenoyl-CoA) and 3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA (the missing carboxylate reduces affinity to the active site) (PubMed:16640564). Originally it was identified as an RNA-binding protein as it binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in vitro (PubMed:7892223). AREs direct rapid RNA degradation and mRNA deadenylation (PubMed:7892223). Might have itaconyl-CoA hydratase activity, converting itaconyl-CoA into citramalyl-CoA in the C5-dicarboxylate catabolism pathway (PubMed:29056341). The C5-dicarboxylate catabolism pathway is required to detoxify itaconate, an antimicrobial metabolite and immunomodulator produced by macrophages during certain infections, that can act as a vitamin B12-poisoning metabolite (PubMed:29056341). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11738050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12434311, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16640564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7892223, ECO:0000303|PubMed:16640564, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29056341}.

In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs. It seems to be involved in degradation of histone mRNA. The catalytic inactive RNA exosome core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9) is proposed to play a pivotal role in the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis, and to serve as a scaffold for the association with catalytic subunits and accessory proteins or complexes. EXOSC2 as peripheral part of the Exo-9 complex stabilizes the hexameric ring of RNase PH-domain subunits through contacts with EXOSC4 and EXOSC7. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17545563}.	EXOSC2 RRP4

In NER, TFIIH acts by opening DNA around the lesion to allow the excision of the damaged oligonucleotide and its replacement by a new DNA fragment. In transcription, TFIIH has an essential role in transcription initiation. When the pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been established, TFIIH is required for promoter opening and promoter escape. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II by the kinase module CAK controls the initiation of transcription.

Upon NMDA receptor-mediated Ca(2+) elevation, promotes dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons and is essential in synapses for full long-term potentiation (LTP) and ERK2-dependent translational activation. Downstream of NMDA receptors, promotes the formation of spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons by phosphorylating ARHGEF7/BETAPIX on 'Ser-694', which results in the enhancement of ARHGEF7 activity and activation of RAC1. Promotes neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth by activation and phosphorylation of MARK2 on 'Ser-91', 'Ser-92', 'Ser-93' and 'Ser-294'. Promotes nuclear export of HDAC5 and binding to 14-3-3 by phosphorylation of 'Ser-259' and 'Ser-498' in the regulation of muscle cell differentiation.

In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs.

Q15759	MK11_HUMAN	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 11 (MAP kinase 11) (MAPK 11) (EC 2.7.11.24) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 beta) (MAP kinase p38 beta) (p38b) (Stress-activated protein kinase 2b) (SAPK2b) (p38-2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	364	ATP binding [GO:0005524]; MAP kinase activity [GO:0004707]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]	FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). MAPK11 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). MAPK11 functions are mostly redundant with those of MAPK14 (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350, PubMed:35857590). Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets (PubMed:12452429, PubMed:20626350). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery. On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Additional examples of p38 MAPK substrates are the FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:15356147, PubMed:9430721). The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590). Phosphorylates methyltransferase DOT1L on 'Ser-834', 'Thr-900', 'Ser-902', 'Thr-984', 'Ser-1001', 'Ser-1009' and 'Ser-1104' (PubMed:38270553). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10330143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15356147, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35857590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:38270553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9430721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687510, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12452429, ECO:0000303|PubMed:20626350}.

Q16539	MK14_HUMAN	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAP kinase 14) (MAPK 14) (EC 2.7.11.24) (Cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding protein) (CSAID-binding protein) (CSBP) (MAP kinase MXI2) (MAX-interacting protein 2) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 alpha) (MAP kinase p38 alpha) (Stress-activated protein kinase 2a) (SAPK2a)	Homo sapiens (Human)	360	ATP binding [GO:0005524]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; MAP kinase activity [GO:0004707]; MAP kinase kinase activity [GO:0004708]; mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 binding [GO:0048273]; NFAT protein binding [GO:0051525]; protein phosphatase binding [GO:0019903]; protein serine kinase activity [GO:0106310]; protein serine/threonine kinase activity [GO:0004674]	FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1 (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery (PubMed:9687510, PubMed:9792677). On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2 (PubMed:11154262). MAPK14 interacts also with casein kinase II, leading to its activation through autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of TP53/p53 (PubMed:10747897). In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar way, MAPK14 phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, regulating its activity towards EGLN3 (PubMed:17003045). MAPK14 may also inhibit the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of the transmembrane protein ATG9 (PubMed:19893488). Another function of MAPK14 is to regulate the endocytosis of membrane receptors by different mechanisms that impinge on the small GTPase RAB5A. In addition, clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization induced by inflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation depends on MAPK14-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR itself as well as of RAB5A effectors (PubMed:16932740). Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17 (PubMed:20188673). Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Another p38 MAPK substrate is FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A (PubMed:10330143, PubMed:9430721, PubMed:9858528). The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers. The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF-kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C which is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins and leads to initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation (PubMed:11333986). Phosphorylates TIAR following DNA damage, releasing TIAR from GADD45A mRNA and preventing mRNA degradation (PubMed:20932473). The p38 MAPKs may also have kinase-independent roles, which are thought to be due to the binding to targets in the absence of phosphorylation. Protein O-Glc-N-acylation catalyzed by the OGT is regulated by MAPK14, and, although OGT does not seem to be phosphorylated by MAPK14, their interaction increases upon MAPK14 activation induced by glucose deprivation. This interaction may regulate OGT activity by recruiting it to specific targets such as neurofilament H, stimulating its O-Glc-N-acylation. Required in mid-fetal development for the growth of embryo-derived blood vessels in the labyrinth layer of the placenta. Also plays an essential role in developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis, through regulation of EPO gene expression (PubMed:10943842). Isoform MXI2 activation is stimulated by mitogens and oxidative stress and only poorly phosphorylates ELK1 and ATF2. Isoform EXIP may play a role in the early onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylates S100A9 at 'Thr-113' (PubMed:15905572). Phosphorylates NLRP1 downstream of MAP3K20/ZAK in response to UV-B irradiation and ribosome collisions, promoting activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome and pyroptosis (PubMed:35857590). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10330143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10747897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10943842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11333986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15905572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16932740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17003045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17724032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19893488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20188673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20932473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35857590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9430721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9792677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9858528}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Activated by phosphorylation by M.tuberculosis EsxA in T-cells leading to inhibition of IFN-gamma production; phosphorylation is apparent within 15 minutes and is inhibited by kinase-specific inhibitors SB203580 and siRNA (PubMed:21586573). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21586573}.

Accelerates sulfur transfer from NFS1 persulfide intermediate to ISCU and to small thiols such as L-cysteine and glutathione leading to persulfuration of these thiols and ultimately sulfide release (PubMed:24971490). Binds ferrous ion and is released from FXN upon the addition of both L-cysteine and reduced FDX2 during [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly (PubMed:29576242). The core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly complex is involved in the de novo synthesis of a [2Fe-2S] cluster, the first step of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein biogenesis. This process is initiated by the cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1:LYRM4:NDUFAB1) that produces persulfide which is delivered on the scaffold protein ISCU in a FXN-dependent manner. Then this complex is stabilized by FDX2 which provides reducing equivalents to accomplish the [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly. Finally, the [2Fe-2S] cluster is transferred from ISCU to chaperone proteins, including HSCB, HSPA9 and GLRX5 (By similarity). May play a role in the protection against iron-catalyzed oxidative stress through its ability to catalyze the oxidation of Fe(2+) to Fe(3+); the oligomeric form but not the monomeric form has in vitro ferroxidase activity (PubMed:15641778). May be able to store large amounts of iron in the form of a ferrihydrite mineral by oligomerization; however, the physiological relevance is unsure as reports are conflicting and the function has only been shown using heterologous overexpression systems (PubMed:11823441, PubMed:12755598).

Catalyzes both 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lysophosphatidylcholine or LPC) reacylation and PC-CL transacylation, that means, it exchanges acyl groups between CL and PC by a combination of forward and reverse transacylations. Also catalyzes transacylations between other phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or PE) and CL, between PC and PE, and between PC and phosphatidate (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate or PA), although at lower rate. Not regiospecific, it transfers acyl groups into any of the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is an important prerequisite for uniformity and symmetry in CL acyl distribution. Cannot transacylate dilysocardiolipin (DLCL), thus, the role of MLCL is limited to that of an acyl acceptor. CoA-independent, it can reshuffle molecular species within a single phospholipid class. Redistributes fatty acids between MLCL, CL, and other lipids, which prolongs the half-life of CL. Its action is completely reversible, which allows for cyclic changes, such as fission and fusion or bending and flattening of the membrane. Hence, by contributing to the flexibility of the lipid composition, it plays an important role in the dynamics of mitochondria membranes. Essential for the final stage of spermatogenesis, spermatid individualization (By similarity). Required for the initiation of mitophagy (PubMed:33096711).

Q16637	SMN_HUMAN	Survival motor neuron protein (Component of gems 1) (Gemin-1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	294	identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]	FUNCTION: The SMN complex catalyzes the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome, and thereby plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs (PubMed:18984161, PubMed:9845364). Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core) (PubMed:18984161). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:18984161). To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A forming an intermediate (PubMed:18984161). Within the SMN complex, SMN1 acts as a structural backbone and together with GEMIN2 it gathers the Sm complex subunits (PubMed:17178713, PubMed:21816274, PubMed:22101937). Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm ultimately triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:31799625). Ensures the correct splicing of U12 intron-containing genes that may be important for normal motor and proprioceptive neurons development (PubMed:23063131). Also required for resolving RNA-DNA hybrids created by RNA polymerase II, that form R-loop in transcription terminal regions, an important step in proper transcription termination (PubMed:26700805).

Q30154	DRB5_HUMAN	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR beta 5 chain (DR beta-5) (DR2-beta-2) (Dw2) (MHC class II antigen DRB5)	Homo sapiens (Human)	266	MHC class II protein complex binding [GO:0023026]; peptide antigen binding [GO:0042605]	FUNCTION: Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading.

In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs. It seems to be involved in degradation of histone mRNA. The catalytic inactive RNA exosome core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9) is proposed to play a pivotal role in the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis, and to serve as a scaffold for the association with catalytic subunits and accessory proteins or complexes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21255825}.

The GDF15-GFRAL aversive response is triggered by stresses, such as anticancer drugs (camptothecin or cisplatin), cancers or drugs such as metformin (PubMed:32661391). Upon interaction with its ligand, GDF15, mediates the GDF15-induced autophosphorylation and activation of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to activation of MAPK- and AKT- signaling pathways (PubMed:31535977, PubMed:32661391). Ligand-binding activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem (By similarity). The GDF15-GFRAL signal induces expression of genes involved in metabolism, such as lipid metabolism in adipose tissues (PubMed:32661391). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6SJE0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28846097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28846098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28846099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28953886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31535977, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32661391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36630958}.

The BAG6/BAT3 complex is involved in the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored/type II transmembrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Recruited to ribosomes, it interacts with the transmembrane region of newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins and together with SGTA and ASNA1 mediates their delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:20676083, PubMed:25535373, PubMed:28104892). Client proteins that cannot be properly delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum are ubiquitinated and sorted to the proteasome (PubMed:28104892). Similarly, the BAG6/BAT3 complex also functions as a sorting platform for proteins of the secretory pathway that are mislocalized to the cytosol either delivering them to the proteasome for degradation or to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:21743475). The BAG6/BAT3 complex also plays a role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), a quality control mechanism that eliminates unwanted proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum through their retrotranslocation to the cytosol and their targeting to the proteasome. It maintains these retrotranslocated proteins in an unfolded yet soluble state condition in the cytosol to ensure their proper delivery to the proteasome (PubMed:21636303). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20676083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21636303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21743475, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25535373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28104892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32395830}.

ARC protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of ARC mRNA into new target cells, where ARC mRNA can undergo activity-dependent translation. ARC capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer ARC mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. Acts as a key regulator of synaptic plasticity: required for protein synthesis-dependent forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) and for the formation of long-term memory. Regulates synaptic plasticity by promoting endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in response to synaptic activity: this endocytic pathway maintains levels of surface AMPARs in response to chronic changes in neuronal activity through synaptic scaling, thereby contributing to neuronal homeostasis. Acts as a postsynaptic mediator of activity-dependent synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum by mediating elimination of surplus climbing fiber synapses. Accumulates at weaker synapses, probably to prevent their undesired enhancement. This suggests that ARC-containing virion-like capsids may be required to eliminate synaptic material. Required to transduce experience into long-lasting changes in visual cortex plasticity and for long-term memory (By similarity). Involved in postsynaptic trafficking and processing of amyloid-beta A4 (APP) via interaction with PSEN1 (By similarity). In addition to its role in synapses, also involved in the regulation of the immune system: specifically expressed in skin-migratory dendritic cells and regulates fast dendritic cell migration, thereby regulating T-cell activation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q63053, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WV31}.

Q86WR0	CCD25_HUMAN	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 25	Homo sapiens (Human)	208	DNA binding [GO:0003677]	FUNCTION: Transmembrane receptor that senses neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and triggers the ILK-PARVB pathway to enhance cell motility (PubMed:32528174). NETs are mainly composed of DNA fibers and are released by neutrophils to bind pathogens during inflammation (PubMed:32528174). Formation of NETs is also associated with cancer metastasis, NET-DNA acting as a chemotactic factor to attract cancer cells (PubMed:32528174). Specifically binds NETs on its extracellular region, in particular the 8-OHdG-enriched DNA present in NETs, and recruits ILK, initiating the ILK-PARVB cascade to induce cytoskeleton rearrangement and directional migration of cells (PubMed:32528174).

Innate immune response is triggered in response to non-CpG double-stranded DNA from viruses and bacteria delivered to the cytoplasm (PubMed:26300263). Acts by binding cyclic dinucleotides: recognizes and binds cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), a second messenger produced by bacteria, cyclic UMP-AMP (2',3'-cUAMP), and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a messenger produced by CGAS in response to DNA virus in the cytosol (PubMed:21947006, PubMed:23258412, PubMed:23707065, PubMed:23722158, PubMed:23747010, PubMed:23910378, PubMed:26229117, PubMed:30842659, PubMed:35388221, PubMed:37379839). Upon binding to c-di-GMP, cUAMP or cGAMP, STING1 oligomerizes, translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum and is phosphorylated by TBK1 on the pLxIS motif, leading to recruitment and subsequent activation of the transcription factor IRF3 to induce expression of type I interferon and exert a potent anti-viral state (PubMed:22394562, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:29973723, PubMed:30842653, PubMed:35045565, PubMed:35388221). Exhibits 2',3' phosphodiester linkage-specific ligand recognition: can bind both 2'-3' linked cGAMP (2'-3'-cGAMP) and 3'-3' linked cGAMP but is preferentially activated by 2'-3' linked cGAMP (PubMed:23747010, PubMed:23910378, PubMed:26300263). The preference for 2'-3'-cGAMP, compared to other linkage isomers is probably due to the ligand itself, whichs adopts an organized free-ligand conformation that resembles the STING1-bound conformation and pays low energy costs in changing into the active conformation (PubMed:26150511). In addition to promote the production of type I interferons, plays a direct role in autophagy (PubMed:30568238, PubMed:30842662). Following cGAMP-binding, STING1 buds from the endoplasmic reticulum into COPII vesicles, which then form the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (PubMed:30842662). The ERGIC serves as the membrane source for WIPI2 recruitment and LC3 lipidation, leading to formation of autophagosomes that target cytosolic DNA or DNA viruses for degradation by the lysosome (PubMed:30842662). Promotes autophagy by acting as a proton channel that directs proton efflux from the Golgi to facilitate MAP1LC3B/LC3B lipidation (PubMed:37535724). The autophagy- and interferon-inducing activities can be uncoupled and autophagy induction is independent of TBK1 phosphorylation (PubMed:30568238, PubMed:30842662). Autophagy is also triggered upon infection by bacteria: following c-di-GMP-binding, which is produced by live Gram-positive bacteria, promotes reticulophagy (By similarity). May be involved in translocon function, the translocon possibly being able to influence the induction of type I interferons (PubMed:18724357). May be involved in transduction of apoptotic signals via its association with the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3TBT3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18724357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18818105, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19433799, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19776740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21947006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22394562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23027953, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23258412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23707065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23722158, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23747010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23910378, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25636800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26150511, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26229117, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26300263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27801882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29973723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30568238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30842653, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30842659, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30842662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35045565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35388221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36808561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37379839, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37535724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37832545}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Antiviral activity is antagonized by oncoproteins, such as papillomavirus (HPV) protein E7 and adenovirus early E1A protein (PubMed:26405230).

Q8N2A8	PLD6_HUMAN	Mitochondrial cardiolipin hydrolase (EC 3.1.4.-) (Choline phosphatase 6) (Mitochondrial phospholipase) (MitoPLD) (Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D6) (Phospholipase D6) (PLD6) (Protein zucchini homolog)	Homo sapiens (Human)	252	cardiolipin hydrolase activity [GO:0035755]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; RNA endonuclease activity, producing 5'-phosphomonoesters [GO:0016891]	FUNCTION: Presents phospholipase and nuclease activities, depending on the different physiological conditions (PubMed:17028579, PubMed:21397847, PubMed:28063496). Interaction with Mitoguardin (MIGA1 or MIGA2) affects the dimer conformation, facilitating the lipase activity over the nuclease activity (PubMed:26711011). Plays a key role in mitochondrial fusion and fission via its phospholipase activity (PubMed:17028579, PubMed:24599962, PubMed:26678338). In its phospholipase role, it uses the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin as substrate to generate phosphatidate (PA or 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate), a second messenger signaling lipid (PubMed:17028579, PubMed:26711011). Production of PA facilitates Mitofusin-mediated fusion, whereas the cleavage of PA by the Lipin family of phosphatases produces diacylgycerol (DAG) which promotes mitochondrial fission (PubMed:24599962). Both Lipin and DAG regulate mitochondrial dynamics and membrane fusion/fission, important processes for adapting mitochondrial metabolism to changes in cell physiology. Mitochondrial fusion enables cells to cope with the increased nucleotide demand during DNA synthesis (PubMed:26678338). Mitochondrial function and dynamics are closely associated with biological processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (PubMed:21397848). Mediator of MYC activity, promotes mitochondrial fusion and activates AMPK which in turn inhibits YAP/TAZ, thereby inducing cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:26678338). The endonuclease activity plays a critical role in PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis during spermatogenesis (PubMed:21397847, PubMed:21397848). Implicated in spermatogenesis and sperm fertility in testicular germ cells, its single strand-specific nuclease activity is critical for the biogenesis/maturation of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). MOV10L1 selectively binds to piRNA precursors and funnels them to the endonuclease that catalyzes the first cleavage step of piRNA processing to generate piRNA intermediate fragments that are subsequently loaded to Piwi proteins. Cleaves either DNA or RNA substrates with similar affinity, producing a 5' phosphate end, in this way it participates in the processing of primary piRNA transcripts. piRNAs provide essential protection against the activity of mobile genetic elements. piRNA-mediated transposon silencing is thus critical for maintaining genome stability, in particular in germline cells when transposons are mobilized as a consequence of wide-spread genomic demethylation (By similarity). PA may act as signaling molecule in the recognition/transport of the precursor RNAs of primary piRNAs (PubMed:21397847). Interacts with tesmin in testes, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis via association with its interacting partner (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q5SWZ9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17028579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21397847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21397848, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24599962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26678338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26711011, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28063496}.

The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/Rabin8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for Rab8 and then the Rab8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation.

Forms a functional kinase and phosphatase pair with BCKDK, serving as a metabolic regulatory node that coordinates branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) with glucose and lipid metabolism via two distinct phosphoprotein targets: mitochondrial BCKDHA subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex and cytosolic ACLY, a lipogenic enzyme of Krebs cycle (PubMed:17336929, PubMed:17374715, PubMed:19411760, PubMed:22291014, PubMed:22589535, PubMed:23086801, PubMed:29779826). At high levels of branched-chain ketoacids, dephosphorylates and activates mitochondrial BCKDH complex, a multisubunit complex consisting of three multimeric components each involved in different steps of BCAA catabolism: E1 composed of BCKDHA and BCKDHB, E2 core composed of DBT monomers, and E3 composed of DLD monomers. Tightly associates with the E2 component of BCKDH complex and dephosphorylates BCKDHA on Ser-337 (PubMed:17336929, PubMed:17374715, PubMed:19411760, PubMed:22291014, PubMed:22589535, PubMed:23086801, PubMed:29779826). Regulates the reversible phosphorylation of ACLY in response to changes in cellular carbohydrate abundance such as occurs during fasting to feeding metabolic transition. At fasting state, appears to dephosphorylate ACLY on Ser-455 and inactivate it. Refeeding stimulates MLXIPL/ChREBP transcription factor, leading to increased BCKDK to PPM1K expression ratio, phosphorylation and activation of ACLY that ultimately results in the generation of malonyl-CoA and oxaloacetate immediate substrates of de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively (PubMed:29779826). Recognizes phosphosites having SxS or RxxS motifs and strictly depends on Mn(2+) ions for the phosphatase activity (PubMed:29779826).

Acts as a key histone deacetylase by catalyzing deacetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-9', 'Lys-18' and 'Lys-56' (H3K9ac, H3K18ac and H3K56ac, respectively), suppressing target gene expression of several transcription factors, including NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19625767, PubMed:21362626, PubMed:23892288, PubMed:23911928, PubMed:24012758, PubMed:26456828, PubMed:26898756, PubMed:27043296, PubMed:27180906, PubMed:30374165, PubMed:33067423). Acts as an inhibitor of transcription elongation by mediating deacetylation of H3K9ac and H3K56ac, preventing release of NELFE from chromatin and causing transcriptional pausing (By similarity). Involved in DNA repair by promoting double-strand break (DSB) repair: acts as a DSB sensor by recognizing and binding DSB sites, leading to (1) recruitment of DNA repair proteins, such as SMARCA5/SNF2H, and (2) deacetylation of histone H3K9ac and H3K56ac (PubMed:23911928, PubMed:31995034, PubMed:32538779).

Q8NEV9	IL27A_HUMAN	Interleukin-27 subunit alpha (IL-27 subunit alpha) (IL-27-A) (IL27-A) (Interleukin-30) (p28)	Homo sapiens (Human)	243	cytokine activity [GO:0005125]; interleukin-27 receptor binding [GO:0045523]; signaling receptor binding [GO:0005102]	FUNCTION: Associates with EBI3 to form the IL-27 interleukin, a heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate immunity. IL-27 has pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, that can regulate T-helper cell development, suppress T-cell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic T-cell activity, induce isotype switching in B-cells, and that has diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4 T-helper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1), type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper T-cells (TH17). It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 T-cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger interferon-gamma/IFN-gamma production of naive CD4 T-cells, binds to the cytokine receptor WSX-1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL-27-mediated signal transduction. IL-27 potentiate the early phase of TH1 response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/TBX21- and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERK-dependent pathways. It also induces STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/T-Bet via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 up-regulation, an event crucial to TH1 cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor TH1 cells development. In CD8 T-cells, it activates STATs as well as GZMB. IL-27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development and of IL-17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 T-cells. While IL-27 suppressed the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the development of anti-inflammatory inducible regulatory T-cells, iTreg, independently of STAT1. IL-27 has also an effect on cytokine production, it suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production, IL-27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6 through direct effects on T-cells. Another important role of IL-27 is its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP-10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II. IL-27 also demonstrates antiviral activity with inhibitory properties on HIV-1 replication. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12121660, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14565860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17068156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18191724}.

Q8TDQ0	HAVR2_HUMAN	Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVcr-2) (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3) (TIMD-3) (T-cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 3) (TIM-3) (T-cell membrane protein 3) (CD antigen CD366)	Homo sapiens (Human)	301	metal ion binding [GO:0046872]	FUNCTION: Cell surface receptor implicated in modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Generally accepted to have an inhibiting function. Reports on stimulating functions suggest that the activity may be influenced by the cellular context and/or the respective ligand (PubMed:24825777). Regulates macrophage activation (PubMed:11823861). Inhibits T-helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1)-mediated auto- and alloimmune responses and promotes immunological tolerance (PubMed:14556005). In CD8+ cells attenuates TCR-induced signaling, specifically by blocking NF-kappaB and NFAT promoter activities resulting in the loss of IL-2 secretion. The function may implicate its association with LCK proposed to impair phosphorylation of TCR subunits, and/or LGALS9-dependent recruitment of PTPRC to the immunological synapse (PubMed:24337741, PubMed:26492563). In contrast, shown to activate TCR-induced signaling in T-cells probably implicating ZAP70, LCP2, LCK and FYN (By similarity). Expressed on Treg cells can inhibit Th17 cell responses (PubMed:24838857). Receptor for LGALS9 (PubMed:16286920, PubMed:24337741). Binding to LGALS9 is believed to result in suppression of T-cell responses; the resulting apoptosis of antigen-specific cells may implicate HAVCR2 phosphorylation and disruption of its association with BAG6. Binding to LGALS9 is proposed to be involved in innate immune response to intracellular pathogens. Expressed on Th1 cells interacts with LGALS9 expressed on Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages to stimulate antibactericidal activity including IL-1 beta secretion and to restrict intracellular bacterial growth (By similarity). However, the function as receptor for LGALS9 has been challenged (PubMed:23555261). Also reported to enhance CD8+ T-cell responses to an acute infection such as by Listeria monocytogenes (By similarity). Receptor for phosphatidylserine (PtSer); PtSer-binding is calcium-dependent. May recognize PtSer on apoptotic cells leading to their phagocytosis. Mediates the engulfment of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells. Expressed on T-cells, promotes conjugation but not engulfment of apoptotic cells. Expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) positively regulates innate immune response and in synergy with Toll-like receptors promotes secretion of TNF-alpha. In tumor-imfiltrating DCs suppresses nucleic acid-mediated innate immune repsonse by interaction with HMGB1 and interfering with nucleic acid-sensing and trafficking of nucleid acids to endosomes (By similarity). Expressed on natural killer (NK) cells acts as a coreceptor to enhance IFN-gamma production in response to LGALS9 (PubMed:22323453). In contrast, shown to suppress NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (PubMed:22383801). Negatively regulates NK cell function in LPS-induced endotoxic shock (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VIM0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11823861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14556005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16286920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22323453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23555261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24838857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26492563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30374066, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24825777}.

Positively regulates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) via phosphatidylserine (PS) recognition; recognizes and binds PS as a ligand which is expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells. Plays an important role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis, by promoting macrophage-mediated efferocytosis and by inhibiting dendritic cell-mediated efferocytosis (By similarity). Negatively regulates Fc epsilon receptor-dependent mast cell activation and allergic responses via binding to ceramide and sphingomyelin which act as ligands (PubMed:24035150). May act as a coreceptor for interleukin 4 (IL-4). Associates with and regulates IL-4 receptor alpha-mediated responses by augmenting IL-4- and IL-13-induced signaling (By similarity). Negatively regulates the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling mediated by MYD88 and TRIF through activation of PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:22043923). Inhibits osteoclast formation.

This pharmacological effect requires nicotinic acid doses that are much higher than those provided by a normal diet. Mediates nicotinic acid-induced apoptosis in mature neutrophils. Receptor activation by nicotinic acid results in reduced cAMP levels which may affect activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and phosphorylation of target proteins, leading to neutrophil apoptosis. The rank order of potency for the displacement of nicotinic acid binding is 5-methyl pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid = pyridine-3-acetic acid > acifran > 5-methyl nicotinic acid = acipimox >> nicotinuric acid = nicotinamide. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17932499}.

Preferred substrate is GABARAPL2 followed by MAP1LC3A and GABARAP (PubMed:12473658, PubMed:15169837, PubMed:17347651, PubMed:21177865, PubMed:21245471, PubMed:22302004). Protease activity is also required to counteract formation of high-molecular weight conjugates of ATG8 proteins (ATG8ylation): acts as a deubiquitinating-like enzyme that removes ATG8 conjugated to other proteins, such as ATG3 (PubMed:31315929, PubMed:33773106). In addition to the protease activity, also mediates delipidation of ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:33909989). Catalyzes delipidation of PE-conjugated forms of ATG8 proteins during macroautophagy (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:33909989). Compared to ATG4B, the major protein for proteolytic activation of ATG8 proteins, shows weaker ability to cleave the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 proteins, while it displays stronger delipidation activity (PubMed:29458288). Involved in phagophore growth during mitophagy independently of its protease activity and of ATG8 proteins: acts by regulating ATG9A trafficking to mitochondria and promoting phagophore-endoplasmic reticulum contacts during the lipid transfer phase of mitophagy (PubMed:33773106). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12473658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15169837, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17347651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21177865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21245471, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22302004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29458288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31315929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32732290, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33773106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33909989}.

Exhibits antiviral activity against HIV-1. After the penetration of retroviral nucleocapsids into target cells of infection and the initiation of reverse transcription, it can induce the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the minus-sense single-strand viral DNA, leading to G-to-A hypermutations in the subsequent plus-strand viral DNA (PubMed:16920826). The resultant detrimental levels of mutations in the proviral genome, along with a deamination-independent mechanism that works prior to the proviral integration, together exert efficient antiretroviral effects in infected target cells. Selectively targets single-stranded DNA and does not deaminate double-stranded DNA or single- or double-stranded RNA.

Lipid droplet fusion promotes their enlargement, restricting lipolysis and favoring lipid storage (PubMed:18334488, PubMed:19843876, PubMed:20049731, PubMed:23399566). Localizes on the lipid droplet surface, at focal contact sites between lipid droplets, and mediates atypical lipid droplet fusion by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and promoting directional net neutral lipid transfer from the smaller to larger lipid droplets (PubMed:18334488, PubMed:19843876, PubMed:20049731, PubMed:23399566). The transfer direction may be driven by the internal pressure difference between the contacting lipid droplet pair (PubMed:18334488, PubMed:19843876, PubMed:20049731, PubMed:23399566). Its role in neutral lipid transfer and lipid droplet enlargement is activated by the interaction with PLIN1 (PubMed:23399566). May also act as a CEBPB coactivator in the white adipose tissue to control the expression of a subset of CEBPB downstream target genes, including SOCS1, SOCS3, TGFB1, TGFBR1, ID2 and XDH (By similarity).

In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs.

Kinetochores, consisting of a centromere-associated inner segment and a microtubule-contacting outer segment, play a crucial role in chromosome segregation by mediating the physical connection between centromeric DNA and spindle microtubules (PubMed:19289083, PubMed:22483620, PubMed:23085020, PubMed:28479321, PubMed:29487209). The outer kinetochore is made up of the ten-subunit KMN network complex, comprising the MIS12, NDC80 and KNL1 complexes, and auxiliary microtubule-associated components such as the SKA complex; together they connect the outer kinetochore with the inner kinetochore, bind microtubules, and mediate interactions with mitotic checkpoint proteins that delay anaphase until chromosomes are bioriented on the spindle (PubMed:17093495, PubMed:19289083, PubMed:23085020, PubMed:28479321, PubMed:29487209). The SKA complex is loaded onto bioriented kinetochores and it facilitates chromosome congression by stabilizing microtubules together with MAPRE1, and end-on attachment of the NDC80 complex to depolymerizing spindle microtubules, thereby assisting the poleward-moving kinetochore in withstanding microtubule pulling forces (PubMed:19289083, PubMed:22371557, PubMed:22454517, PubMed:23085020, PubMed:24413531, PubMed:27697923, PubMed:28479321, PubMed:28495837, PubMed:29487209). The complex associates with dynamic microtubule plus-ends and can track both depolymerizing and elongating microtubules (PubMed:23085020, PubMed:29153323). The complex recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the kinetochore in prometaphase and metaphase, to oppose spindle assembly checkpoint signaling and promote the onset of anaphase (PubMed:26981768). In the complex, it mediates interactions with microtubules (PubMed:19289083, PubMed:22483620, PubMed:23085020, PubMed:24413531, PubMed:27667719, PubMed:29153323, PubMed:36592928).

Its anti-apoptotic activity is mediated through the inhibition of CASP3, CASP7 and CASP9, as well as by its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (PubMed:11024045, PubMed:16729033). As it is a weak caspase inhibitor, its anti-apoptotic activity is thought to be due to its ability to ubiquitinate DIABLO/SMAC targeting it for degradation thereby promoting cell survival (PubMed:16729033). May contribute to caspase inhibition, by blocking the ability of DIABLO/SMAC to disrupt XIAP/BIRC4-caspase interactions (PubMed:16729033). Protects against apoptosis induced by TNF or by chemical agents such as adriamycin, etoposide or staurosporine (PubMed:11084335, PubMed:11162435, PubMed:11865055).

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: upon phosphorylation by AURKB, together with ZFYVE19/ANCHR, retains abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis. Deactivation of AURKB results in dephosphorylation of CHMP4C followed by its dissociation from ANCHR and VPS4 and subsequent abscission (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release. CHMP4A/B/C are required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14505569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14505570, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14519844, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22422861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22660413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24814515}.

Assembles with ORAI2 and ORAI3 to form hexameric CRAC channels that mediate Ca(2+) influx upon depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store and channel activation by Ca(2+) sensor STIM1, a process known as store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Various pore subunit combinations may account for distinct CRAC channel spatiotemporal and cell-type specific dynamics. ORAI1 mainly contributes to the generation of Ca(2+) plateaus involved in sustained Ca(2+) entry and is dispensable for cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations, whereas ORAI2 and ORAI3 generate oscillatory patterns. CRAC channels assemble in Ca(2+) signaling microdomains where Ca(2+) influx is coupled to calmodulin and calcineurin signaling and activation of NFAT transcription factors recruited to ORAI1 via AKAP5. Activates NFATC2/NFAT1 and NFATC3/NFAT4-mediated transcriptional responses. CRAC channels are the main pathway for Ca(2+) influx in T cells and promote the immune response to pathogens by activating NFAT-dependent cytokine and chemokine transcription (PubMed:16582901, PubMed:17442569, PubMed:19182790, PubMed:20354224, PubMed:22641696, PubMed:26221052, PubMed:32415068, PubMed:33941685).

SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. Triggers cytolytic activity only in natural killer cells (NK) expressing high surface densities of natural cytotoxicity receptors (PubMed:11489943, PubMed:16920955). Positive signaling in NK cells implicates phosphorylation of VAV1. NK cell activation seems to depend on SH2D1B and not on SH2D1A (PubMed:16920955). In conjunction with SLAMF1 controls the transition between positive selection and the subsequent expansion and differentiation of the thymocytic natural killer T (NKT) cell lineage (By similarity). Promotes T-cell differentiation into a helper T-cell Th17 phenotype leading to increased IL-17 secretion; the costimulatory activity requires SH2D1A (PubMed:16920955, PubMed:22184727). Promotes recruitment of RORC to the IL-17 promoter (PubMed:22989874). In conjunction with SLAMF1 and CD84/SLAMF5 may be a negative regulator of the humoral immune response. In the absence of SH2D1A/SAP can transmit negative signals to CD4(+) T-cells and NKT cells. Negatively regulates germinal center formation by inhibiting T-cell:B-cell adhesion; the function probably implicates increased association with PTPN6/SHP-1 via ITSMs in absence of SH2D1A/SAP.

Q96F25	ALG14_HUMAN	UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase subunit ALG14 (Asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 homolog)	Homo sapiens (Human)	216	protein-membrane adaptor activity [GO:0043495]	FUNCTION: Part of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex that operates in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, the glycan precursors employed in protein asparagine (N)-glycosylation. The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharides are transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. Functions as a protein-membrane adapter recruiting ALG13 at the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, where the complex catalyzes the second step of dolichol pyrophosphate biosynthesis, transferring a beta1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-pyrophosphatedolichol (Gn-PDol) to produce N,N'-diacetylchitobiosyl diphosphodolichol. N,N'-diacetylchitobiosyl diphosphodolichol is a substrate for ALG1, the following enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16100110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36200043}.	ALG14

Regulator of T-cell anergy, a phenomenon that occurs when T-cells are rendered unresponsive to antigen rechallenge and no longer respond to their cognate antigen (PubMed:14661020). Acts via its interaction with RNF128/GRAIL, a crucial inductor of CD4 T-cell anergy (PubMed:14661020). Isoform 1 destabilizes RNF128, leading to prevent anergy (PubMed:14661020). In contrast, isoform 2 stabilizes RNF128 and promotes anergy (PubMed:14661020). Surprisingly, it regulates RNF128-mediated ubiquitination, but does not deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated RNF128 (PubMed:14661020). Deubiquitinates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) (PubMed:19383985). Mediates deubiquitination of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains, but not 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:18954305, PubMed:19211026, PubMed:23827681). Not able to cleave di-ubiquitin (PubMed:18954305, PubMed:23827681). Also capable of removing NEDD8 from NEDD8 conjugates, but with a much lower preference compared to 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitin (PubMed:18954305, PubMed:23827681). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12401499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12704427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14661020, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18954305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19211026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19383985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23827681}.; FUNCTION: Plays a key non-catalytic role in DNA repair regulation by inhibiting activity of RNF168, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes accumulation of 'Lys-63'-linked histone H2A and H2AX at DNA damage sites (PubMed:20725033, PubMed:22325355). Inhibits RNF168 independently of ubiquitin thioesterase activity by binding and inhibiting UBE2N/UBC13, the E2 partner of RNF168, thereby limiting spreading of 'Lys-63'-linked histone H2A and H2AX marks (PubMed:20725033, PubMed:22325355). Inhibition occurs by binding to free ubiquitin: free ubiquitin acts as an allosteric regulator that increases affinity for UBE2N/UBC13 and disrupts interaction with UBE2V1 (PubMed:20725033, PubMed:22325355). The OTUB1-UBE2N/UBC13-free ubiquitin complex adopts a configuration that mimics a cleaved 'Lys48'-linked di-ubiquitin chain (PubMed:20725033, PubMed:22325355). Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes (PubMed:29382726, PubMed:35927303). When phosphorylated at Tyr-26, acts as an activator of the mTORC1 complex by mediating deubiquitination of RPTOR via a non-catalytic process: acts by binding and inhibiting the activity of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2D1/UBCH5A, UBE2W/UBC16 and UBE2N/UBC13), thereby preventing ubiquitination of RPTOR (PubMed:35927303). Can also act as an inhibitor of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes in response to amino acids by mediating non-catalytic deubiquitination of DEPTOR (PubMed:29382726). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20725033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22325355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29382726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35927303}.

Acts as an enzyme that recognizes and binds abasic sites in ssDNA at replication forks and chemically modifies the lesion by forming a covalent cross-link with DNA: forms a stable thiazolidine linkage between a ring-opened abasic site and the alpha-amino and sulfhydryl substituents of its N-terminal catalytic cysteine residue (PubMed:30554877, PubMed:31235913). Promotes error-free repair by protecting abasic sites from translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases and endonucleases that are error-prone and would generate mutations and double-strand breaks (PubMed:30554877). The HMCES DNA-protein cross-link is then either reversed or degraded (PubMed:30554877, PubMed:36608669, PubMed:37519246, PubMed:37950866). HMCES is able to catalyze the reversal of its thiazolidine cross-link and cycle between a cross-link and a non-cross-linked state depending on DNA context: mediates self-reversal of the thiazolidine cross-link in double stranded DNA, allowing APEX1 to initiate downstream repair of abasic sites (PubMed:37519246, PubMed:37950866). The HMCES DNA-protein cross-link can also be degraded by the SPRTN metalloprotease following unfolding by the BRIP1/FANCJ helicase (PubMed:36608669). Has preference for ssDNA, but can also accommodate double-stranded DNA with 3' or 5' overhang (dsDNA), and dsDNA-ssDNA 3' junction (PubMed:31235915, PubMed:31806351). Plays a protective role during somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes in B-cells: acts via its ability to form covalent cross-links with abasic sites, thereby limiting the accumulation of deletions in somatic hypermutation target regions (PubMed:35450882). Also involved in class switch recombination (CSR) in B-cells independently of the formation of a DNA-protein cross-link: acts by binding and protecting ssDNA overhangs to promote DNA double-strand break repair through the microhomology-mediated alternative-end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway (By similarity). Acts as a protease: mediates autocatalytic processing of its N-terminal methionine in order to expose the catalytic cysteine (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8R1M0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30554877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31235913, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31235915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31806351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32307824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32492421, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35450882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36608669, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37519246, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37950866}.

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. In the ESCRT-III complex, it probably serves as an acceptor for the ESCRT-II complex on endosomal membranes.	CHMP6 VPS20

The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074, PubMed:14722118, PubMed:26829474). Involved in the bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and is a key regulator for the onset of cytokinesis during mitosis (PubMed:15249581). Required for central/midzone spindle assembly and cleavage furrow formation (PubMed:12458200, PubMed:12686604). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: phosphorylates CHMP4C, leading to retain abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). AURKB phosphorylates the CPC complex subunits BIRC5/survivin, CDCA8/borealin and INCENP (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074). Phosphorylation of INCENP leads to increased AURKB activity (PubMed:11516652, PubMed:12925766, PubMed:14610074). Other known AURKB substrates involved in centromeric functions and mitosis are CENPA, DES/desmin, GPAF, KIF2C, NSUN2, RACGAP1, SEPTIN1, VIM/vimentin, HASPIN, and histone H3 (PubMed:11756469, PubMed:11784863, PubMed:11856369, PubMed:12689593, PubMed:14602875, PubMed:16103226, PubMed:21658950). A positive feedback loop involving HASPIN and AURKB contributes to localization of CPC to centromeres (PubMed:21658950). Phosphorylation of VIM controls vimentin filament segregation in cytokinetic process, whereas histone H3 is phosphorylated at 'Ser-10' and 'Ser-28' during mitosis (H3S10ph and H3S28ph, respectively) (PubMed:11784863, PubMed:11856369). AURKB is also required for kinetochore localization of BUB1 and SGO1 (PubMed:15020684, PubMed:17617734). Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity (PubMed:20959462). Key regulator of active promoters in resting B- and T-lymphocytes: acts by mediating phosphorylation of H3S28ph at active promoters in resting B-cells, inhibiting RNF2/RING1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes (By similarity). Acts as an inhibitor of CGAS during mitosis: catalyzes phosphorylation of the N-terminus of CGAS during the G2-M transition, blocking CGAS liquid phase separation and activation, and thereby preventing CGAS-induced autoimmunity (PubMed:33542149). Phosphorylates KRT5 during anaphase and telophase (By similarity).

Modulates cellular senescence by regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Mechanistically, participates in mitochondrial fission through dephosphorylating DNM1L/DRP1 (PubMed:32439975). Additionally, dephosphorylates MFN2 in a stress-sensitive manner and consequently protects it from ubiquitination and degradation to promote mitochondrial network formation (PubMed:37498743). Regulates mitophagy independent of PARKIN by interacting with and dephosphorylating FUNDC1, which interacts with LC3 (PubMed:24746696).

Q96HY6	DDRGK_HUMAN	DDRGK domain-containing protein 1 (Dashurin) (UFM1-binding and PCI domain-containing protein 1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	314	RNA polymerase II-specific DNA-binding transcription factor binding [GO:0061629]; ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding [GO:0044389]; UFM1-modified protein reader activity [GO:0141185]	FUNCTION: Component of the UFM1 ribosome E3 ligase (UREL) complex, a multiprotein complex that catalyzes ufmylation of endoplasmic reticulum-docked proteins (PubMed:30626644, PubMed:32160526, PubMed:35753586, PubMed:36121123, PubMed:36543799, PubMed:37595036, PubMed:37795761, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). The UREL complex plays a key role in ribosome recycling by mediating mono-ufmylation of the RPL26/uL24 subunit of the 60S ribosome following ribosome dissociation: ufmylation weakens the junction between post-termination 60S subunits and SEC61 translocons, promoting release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 and subsequent 60S ribosome recycling either take place after normal termination of translation or after ribosome stalling during cotranslational translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:37595036, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Within the UREL complex, DDRGK1 tethers the complex to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to restrict its activity to endoplasmic reticulum-docked ribosomes and acts as an ufmylation 'reader': following RPL26/uL24 ufmylation, DDRGK1 specifically binds to ufmylated RPL26/uL24 via its UFIM motif, resulting in stable association between the 60S ribosome and the UREL complex, followed by dissociation of the 60S ribosome subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:36121123, PubMed:37595036, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). The UREL complex is also involved in reticulophagy in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress by promoting ufmylation of proteins such as CYB5R3 and RPN1, thereby promoting lysosomal degradation of ufmylated proteins (PubMed:32160526, PubMed:36543799). Ufmylation-dependent reticulophagy inhibits the unfolded protein response (UPR) by regulating ERN1/IRE1-alpha stability (PubMed:28128204, PubMed:32160526). Acts as a regulator of immunity by promoting differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells: acts by promoting expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum and regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) (By similarity).

Catalyzes the third step in the beta-oxidation cycle, namely the reversible conversion of (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA. Preferentially accepts straight medium- and short-chain acyl-CoA substrates with highest efficiency for (3S)-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA (PubMed:10600649, PubMed:12917011, PubMed:25925575, PubMed:26950678, PubMed:9553139).

The aversive response is both required to reduce continuing exposure to those stresses at the time of exposure and to promote avoidance behavior in the future (PubMed:30639358, PubMed:33589633, PubMed:38092039). Acts by binding to its receptor, GFRAL, activating GFRAL-expressing neurons localized in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem (PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:28953886, PubMed:31535977). It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitutes part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes responses to stressful conditions (PubMed:28953886). The GDF15-GFRAL signal induces expression of genes involved in metabolism, such as lipid metabolism in adipose tissues (PubMed:31402172). Required for avoidance behavior in response to food allergens: induced downstream of mast cell activation to promote aversion and minimize harmful effects of exposure to noxious substances (By similarity). In addition to suppress appetite, also promotes weight loss by enhancing energy expenditure in muscle: acts by increasing calcium futile cycling in muscle (By similarity). Contributes to the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, on appetite reduction and weight loss: produced in the kidney in response to metformin treatment, thereby activating the GDF15-GFRAL response, leading to reduced appetite and weight (PubMed:31875646, PubMed:37060902). The contribution of GDF15 to weight loss following metformin treatment is however limited and subject to discussion (PubMed:36001956). Produced in response to anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin or cisplatin, promoting nausea, vomiting and contributing to malnutrition (By similarity). Overproduced in many cancers, promoting anorexia in cancer (cachexia) (PubMed:32661391). Responsible for the risk of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy: high levels of GDF15 during pregnancy, mostly originating from the fetus, are associated with increased nausea and vomiting (PubMed:38092039). Maternal sensitivity to nausea is probably determined by pre-pregnancy exposure to GDF15, women with naturally high level of GDF15 being less susceptible to nausea than women with low levels of GDF15 before pregnancy (PubMed:38092039). Promotes metabolic adaptation in response to systemic inflammation caused by bacterial and viral infections in order to promote tissue tolerance and prevent tissue damage (PubMed:31402172).

In absence of DNA damage, interacts with the tandem Tudor-like domain of TP53BP1, masking the region that binds histone H4 dimethylated at 'Lys-20' (H4K20me2), thereby preventing TP53BP1 recruitment to chromatin and maintaining TP53BP1 localization to the nucleus (PubMed:28241136). Following DNA damage, ATM-induced phosphorylation of TP53BP1 and subsequent recruitment of RIF1 leads to dissociate NUDT16L1/TIRR from TP53BP1, unmasking the tandem Tudor-like domain and allowing recruitment of TP53BP1 to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:28241136).

Q9BRP8	PYM1_HUMAN	Partner of Y14 and mago (PYM homolog 1 exon junction complex-associated factor) (Protein wibg homolog)	Homo sapiens (Human)	204	ribosome binding [GO:0043022]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]	FUNCTION: Key regulator of the exon junction complex (EJC), a multiprotein complex that associates immediately upstream of the exon-exon junction on mRNAs and serves as a positional landmark for the intron exon structure of genes and directs post-transcriptional processes in the cytoplasm such as mRNA export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or translation. Acts as an EJC disassembly factor, allowing translation-dependent EJC removal and recycling by disrupting mature EJC from spliced mRNAs. Its association with the 40S ribosomal subunit probably prevents a translation-independent disassembly of the EJC from spliced mRNAs, by restricting its activity to mRNAs that have been translated. Interferes with NMD and enhances translation of spliced mRNAs, probably by antagonizing EJC functions. May bind RNA; the relevance of RNA-binding remains unclear in vivo, RNA-binding was detected by PubMed:14968132, while PubMed:19410547 did not detect RNA-binding activity independently of the EJC. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18026120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19410547}.

Assembles with ORAI1 and ORAI2 to form hexameric CRAC channels that mediate Ca(2+) influx upon depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store and channel activation by Ca(2+) sensor STIM1, a process known as store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Various pore subunit combinations may account for distinct CRAC channel spatiotemporal and cell-type specific dynamics. ORAI1 mainly contributes to the generation of Ca(2+) plateaus involved in sustained Ca(2+) entry and is dispensable for cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations, whereas ORAI2 and ORAI3 generate oscillatory patterns. CRAC channels assemble in Ca(2+) signaling microdomains where Ca(2+) influx is coupled to calmodulin and calcineurin signaling and activation of NFAT transcription factors recruited to ORAI1 via AKAP5. CRAC channels are the main pathway for Ca(2+) influx in T cells and promote the immune response to pathogens by activating NFAT-dependent cytokine and chemokine transcription (PubMed:16807233, PubMed:17442569, PubMed:19182790, PubMed:19706554, PubMed:20354224, PubMed:32415068).

At the plasma membrane, catalyzes reduction of coenzyme Q/ubiquinone-10 to ubiquinol-10, a lipophilic radical-trapping antioxidant that prevents lipid oxidative damage and consequently ferroptosis (PubMed:31634899, PubMed:31634900). Acts in parallel to GPX4 to suppress phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (PubMed:31634899, PubMed:31634900). This anti-ferroptotic function is independent of cellular glutathione levels (PubMed:31634899, PubMed:31634900). Also acts as a potent radical-trapping antioxidant by mediating warfarin-resistant vitamin K reduction in the canonical vitamin K cycle: catalyzes NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of vitamin K (phylloquinone, menaquinone-4 and menadione) to hydroquinone forms (PubMed:35922516). Hydroquinones act as potent radical-trapping antioxidants inhibitor of phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (PubMed:35922516). May play a role in mitochondrial stress signaling (PubMed:26689472). Upon oxidative stress, associates with the lipid peroxidation end product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) forming a lipid adduct devoid of oxidoreductase activity, which then translocates from mitochondria into the nucleus triggering DNA damage and cell death (PubMed:26689472).

It cleaves pre-tRNA at the 5'- and 3'-splice sites to release the intron. The products are an intron and two tRNA half-molecules bearing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH termini. There are no conserved sequences at the splice sites, but the intron is invariably located at the same site in the gene, placing the splice sites an invariant distance from the constant structural features of the tRNA body. It probably carries the active site for 3'-splice site cleavage. The tRNA splicing endonuclease is also involved in mRNA processing via its association with pre-mRNA 3'-end processing factors, establishing a link between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3'-end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA-processing events. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109492}.

Q9BVC4	LST8_HUMAN	Target of rapamycin complex subunit LST8 (TORC subunit LST8) (G protein beta subunit-like) (Gable) (Protein GbetaL) (Mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) (mLST8)	Homo sapiens (Human)	326	protein serine/threonine kinase activator activity [GO:0043539]	FUNCTION: Subunit of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, which regulates cell growth and survival in response to nutrient and hormonal signals (PubMed:12718876, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24403073). mTORC1 is activated in response to growth factors or amino acids (PubMed:12718876, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24403073). In response to nutrients, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating several substrates, such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2) and EIF4EBP1 (4E-BP1) (PubMed:12718876, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24403073). In the same time, it inhibits catabolic pathways by phosphorylating the autophagy initiation components ULK1 and ATG13, as well as transcription factor TFEB, a master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy (PubMed:24403073). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:24403073). Within mTORC1, LST8 interacts directly with MTOR and enhances its kinase activity (PubMed:12718876). In nutrient-poor conditions, stabilizes the MTOR-RPTOR interaction and favors RPTOR-mediated inhibition of MTOR activity (PubMed:12718876). mTORC2 is also activated by growth factors, but seems to be nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, probably by activating one or more Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 promotes the serum-induced formation of stress-fibers or F-actin (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 'Ser-473' phosphorylation, which may facilitate the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 also modulates the phosphorylation of PRKCA on 'Ser-657' (PubMed:15467718). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15268862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15467718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24403073}.

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. When overexpressed, membrane-assembled circular arrays of CHMP4A filaments can promote or stabilize negative curvature and outward budding.

Q9BZW8	CD244_HUMAN	Natural killer cell receptor 2B4 (NK cell activation-inducing ligand) (NAIL) (NK cell type I receptor protein 2B4) (NKR2B4) (h2B4) (SLAM family member 4) (SLAMF4) (Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule 4) (CD antigen CD244)	Homo sapiens (Human)	370	MHC class I protein binding [GO:0042288]; signaling receptor activity [GO:0038023]	FUNCTION: Heterophilic receptor of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family; its ligand is CD48. SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. Acts as activating natural killer (NK) cell receptor (PubMed:10359122, PubMed:11714776, PubMed:8376943). Activating function implicates association with SH2D1A and FYN (PubMed:15713798). Downstreaming signaling involves predominantly VAV1, and, to a lesser degree, INPP5D/SHIP1 and CBL. Signal attenuation in the absence of SH2D1A is proposed to be dependent on INPP5D and to a lesser extent PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:10934222, PubMed:15713798). Stimulates NK cell cytotoxicity, production of IFN-gamma and granule exocytosis (PubMed:11714776, PubMed:8376943). Optimal expansion and activation of NK cells seems to be dependent on the engagement of CD244 with CD48 expressed on neighboring NK cells (By similarity). Acts as costimulator in NK activation by enhancing signals by other NK receptors such as NCR3 and NCR1 (PubMed:10741393). At early stages of NK cell differentiation may function as an inhibitory receptor possibly ensuring the self-tolerance of developing NK cells (PubMed:11917118). Involved in the regulation of CD8(+) T-cell proliferation; expression on activated T-cells and binding to CD48 provides costimulatory-like function for neighboring T-cells (By similarity).

Also plays a key role in cell fate determination by promoting mesorderm induction and adipocyte differentiation (By similarity). Mechanistically, associates with the RNA polymerase III clamp and thereby impairs its recruitment to the complex made of the promoter DNA, TBP and the initiation factor TFIIIB (PubMed:17505538, PubMed:20887893). When nutrients are available and mTOR kinase is active, MAF1 is hyperphosphorylated and RNA polymerase III is engaged in transcription.

Cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and the matrix-open state (m-state): operates by the alternating access mechanism with a single substrate-binding site intermittently exposed to either the cytosolic (c-state) or matrix (m-state) side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (By similarity). Specifically required during spermatogenesis, probably to mediate ADP:ATP exchange in spermatocytes (PubMed:17137571). Large ATP supplies from mitochondria may be critical for normal progression of spermatogenesis during early stages of meiotic prophase I, including DNA double-strand break repair and chromosomal synapsis (By similarity). In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (By similarity). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A31/ANT4 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Among nucleotides, may also exchange ADP for dATP and dADP (PubMed:15670820). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (By similarity). It is however unclear if SLC25A31/ANT4 constitutes a pore-forming component of mPTP or regulates it (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:G2QNH0, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P48962, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3V132, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15670820, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17137571}.

LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331).

The CST complex binds single-stranded DNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner, while isolated subunits bind DNA with low affinity by themselves. Initially the CST complex has been proposed to protect telomeres from DNA degradation (PubMed:19854130). However, the CST complex has been shown to be involved in several aspects of telomere replication. The CST complex inhibits telomerase and is involved in telomere length homeostasis; it is proposed to bind to newly telomerase-synthesized 3' overhangs and to terminate telomerase action implicating the association with the ACD:POT1 complex thus interfering with its telomerase stimulation activity. The CST complex is also proposed to be involved in fill-in synthesis of the telomeric C-strand probably implicating recruitment and activation of DNA polymerase alpha (PubMed:22763445, PubMed:22964711). The CST complex facilitates recovery from many forms of exogenous DNA damage; seems to be involved in the re-initiation of DNA replication at repaired forks and/or dormant origins (PubMed:25483097). Required for efficicient replication of the duplex region of the telomere. Promotes efficient replication of lagging-strand telomeres (PubMed:22863775, PubMed:22964711).

Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324). Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324).

Hydroxylation on the NODD site by EGLN3 appears to require prior hydroxylation on the CODD site (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12181324).

Plays a key role in NHEJ by promoting the ligation of various mismatched and non-cohesive ends (PubMed:17470781, PubMed:17717001, PubMed:19056826). Together with PAXX, collaborates with DNA polymerase lambda (POLL) to promote joining of non-cohesive DNA ends (PubMed:25670504, PubMed:30250067). May act in concert with XRCC5-XRCC6 (Ku) to stimulate XRCC4-mediated joining of blunt ends and several types of mismatched ends that are non-complementary or partially complementary (PubMed:16439204, PubMed:16439205, PubMed:17317666, PubMed:17470781). In some studies, has been shown to associate with XRCC4 to form alternating helical filaments that bridge DNA and act like a bandage, holding together the broken DNA until it is repaired (PubMed:21768349, PubMed:21775435, PubMed:22228831, PubMed:22287571, PubMed:26100018, PubMed:27437582, PubMed:28500754). Alternatively, it has also been shown that rather than forming filaments, a single NHEJ1 dimer interacts through both head domains with XRCC4 to promote the close alignment of DNA ends (By similarity). The XRCC4-NHEJ1/XLF subcomplex binds to the DNA fragments of a DSB in a highly diffusive manner and robustly bridges two independent DNA molecules, holding the broken DNA fragments in close proximity to one other (PubMed:27437582, PubMed:28500754). The mobility of the bridges ensures that the ends remain accessible for further processing by other repair factors (PubMed:27437582). Binds DNA in a length-dependent manner (PubMed:17317666, PubMed:18158905). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A0A1L8ENT6, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16439204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16439205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17470781, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17717001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18158905, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18644470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19056826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20558749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21768349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21775435, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22228831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22287571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25670504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26100018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27437582, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28500754, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30250067}.

Seems to recognize a common structural G-quartet (G4) feature in its miRNA and mRNA targets (Probable). 'Translational enhancer' that drives specific mRNAs to polysomes and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis. Its association with the translational machinery and target mRNAs results in an increased number of initiation events per molecule of mRNA and, indirectly, in mRNA stabilization. Binds IGF2 mRNA, MYOD1 mRNA, ARBP/36B4 ribosomal protein mRNA and its own mRNA. Essential for skeletal muscle differentiation program through the translational up-regulation of IGF2 expression. Suppressor of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, including that of let-7, miR107, miR-143 and miR-200c. Specifically binds the miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs), recognizing an 5'-GGAG-3' motif found in pre-miRNA terminal loop, and recruits TUT4 and TUT7 uridylyltransferases (PubMed:18951094, PubMed:19703396, PubMed:22118463, PubMed:22898984). This results in the terminal uridylation of target pre-miRNAs (PubMed:18951094, PubMed:19703396, PubMed:22118463, PubMed:22898984). Uridylated pre-miRNAs fail to be processed by Dicer and undergo degradation. The repression of let-7 expression is required for normal development and contributes to maintain the pluripotent state by preventing let-7-mediated differentiation of embryonic stem cells (PubMed:18951094, PubMed:19703396, PubMed:22118463, PubMed:22898984). Localized to the periendoplasmic reticulum area, binds to a large number of spliced mRNAs and inhibits the translation of mRNAs destined for the ER, reducing the synthesis of transmembrane proteins, ER or Golgi lumen proteins, and secretory proteins. Binds to and enhances the translation of mRNAs for several metabolic enzymes, such as PFKP, PDHA1 or SDHA, increasing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.

Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Acts as a receptor for chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CCL13, CCL19, CCL21 and CCL25. Chemokine-binding does not activate G-protein-mediated signal transduction but instead induces beta-arrestin recruitment, leading to ligand internalization. Plays an important role in controlling the migration of immune and cancer cells that express chemokine receptors CCR7 and CCR9, by reducing the availability of CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 through internalization. Negatively regulates CXCR3-induced chemotaxis. Regulates T-cell development in the thymus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10706668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23121557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23341447}.

Voltage sensing is coupled to K(+) electrochemical gradient in an 'ion flux gating' mode where outward but not inward ion flow opens the gate (PubMed:11042359, PubMed:11431495, PubMed:26919430, PubMed:38630723). Changes ion selectivity and becomes permeable to Na(+) ions in response to extracellular acidification. Protonation of the pH sensor His-98 stabilizes C-type inactivation conformation likely converting the channel from outward K(+)-conducting, to inward Na(+)-conducting to nonconductive state (PubMed:22948150, PubMed:38630723). Homo- and heterodimerizes to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties (By similarity) (PubMed:23169818, PubMed:38630723). Allows K(+) currents with fast-gating kinetics important for the repolarization and hyperpolarization phases of action potentials (By similarity). In granule neurons, hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential to limit intrinsic neuronal excitability, but once the action potential threshold is reached, supports high-frequency action potential firing and increased neuronal excitability. Homomeric and/or heteromeric KCNK3:KCNK9 channels operate in cerebellar granule cells, whereas heteromeric KCNK1:KCNK9 enables currents in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule neurons (By similarity). Dispensable for central chemosensory respiration i.e. breathing controlled by brainstem CO2/pH, it rather conducts pH-sensitive currents and controls the firing rate of serotonergic raphe neurons involved in potentiation of the respiratory chemoreflex (By similarity). In retinal ganglion cells, mediates outward currents that regulate action potentials in response to acidification of the synaptic cleft. Involved in transmission of image-forming and nonimage-forming visual information in the retina (By similarity). In adrenal gland, contributes to the maintenance of a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential of aldosterone-producing cells at zona glomerulosa and limits aldosterone release as part of a regulatory mechanism that controls arterial blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3LS21, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9ES08, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11042359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11431495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22948150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23169818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26919430, ECO:0000269|PubMed:38630723}.

During kidney development, maintains cap mesenchyme multipotent nephron progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state by opposing the inductive signals emanating from the ureteric bud and cooperates with WNT9B to promote renewing progenitor cells proliferation. Acts through its interaction with TCF7L2 and OSR1 in a canonical Wnt signaling independent manner preventing transcription of differentiation genes in cap mesenchyme such as WNT4. Also acts independently of OSR1 to activate expression of many cap mesenchyme genes, including itself, GDNF and OSR1.

In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs. It seems to be involved in degradation of histone mRNA. The catalytic inactive RNA exosome core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9) is proposed to play a pivotal role in the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis, and to serve as a scaffold for the association with catalytic subunits and accessory proteins or complexes.

Acts as a negative regulator of glycolysis by lowering intracellular levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in a p53/TP53-dependent manner, resulting in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activation and NADPH production (PubMed:16839880, PubMed:22887998). Contributes to the generation of reduced glutathione to cause a decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, correlating with its ability to protect cells from oxidative or metabolic stress-induced cell death (PubMed:16839880, PubMed:19713938, PubMed:22887998, PubMed:23726973, PubMed:23817040). Plays a role in promoting protection against cell death during hypoxia by decreasing mitochondria ROS levels in a HK2-dependent manner through a mechanism that is independent of its fructose-bisphosphatase activity (PubMed:23185017). In response to cardiac damage stress, mediates p53-induced inhibition of myocyte mitophagy through ROS levels reduction and the subsequent inactivation of BNIP3. Reduced mitophagy results in an enhanced apoptotic myocyte cell death, and exacerbates cardiac damage (By similarity). Plays a role in adult intestinal regeneration; contributes to the growth, proliferation and survival of intestinal crypts following tissue ablation (PubMed:23726973). Plays a neuroprotective role against ischemic brain damage by enhancing PPP flux and preserving mitochondria functions (By similarity). Protects glioma cells from hypoxia- and ROS-induced cell death by inhibiting glycolysis and activating mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxygen consumption in a TKTL1-dependent and p53/TP53-independent manner (PubMed:22887998).

Forms heterodimeric Rag complexes with RagA/RRAGA or RagB/RRAGB and cycles between an inactive GTP-bound and an active GDP-bound form: RagD/RRAGD is in its active form when GDP-bound RagD/RRAGD forms a complex with GTP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) and in an inactive form when GTP-bound RagD/RRAGD heterodimerizes with GDP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) (PubMed:24095279). In its active form, promotes the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and its subsequent activation by the GTPase RHEB (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279). This is a crucial step in the activation of the MTOR signaling cascade by amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279).

In addition to protein deacetylase activity, also acts as a protein-lysine deacylase (PubMed:27436229, PubMed:27997115, PubMed:31542297). Acts as a protein depropionylase by mediating depropionylation of Osterix (SP7), thereby regulating bone formation by osteoblasts (By similarity).

Serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage (PubMed:29480802). HPF1 acts by completing the active site of PARP1 and PARP2: forms a composite active site composed of residues from HPF1 and PARP1 or PARP2 (PubMed:32028527, PubMed:33589610). While HPF1 promotes the initiation of serine ADP-ribosylation, it restricts the polymerase activity of PARP1 and PARP2 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:33683197, PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). HPF1 also promotes tyrosine ADP-ribosylation, probably by conferring tyrosine specificity on PARP1 (PubMed:29954836, PubMed:30257210). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27067600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28190768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29480802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29954836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30257210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32028527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32939087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33186521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33589610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33683197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34108479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34210965, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34486521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34625544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34732825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34795260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34874266}.

Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A forming an intermediate. Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17023415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161}.

Component of the BRISC complex, a multiprotein complex that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin in various substrates (PubMed:19214193, PubMed:24075985, PubMed:25283148, PubMed:26195665). Within the BRISC complex, acts as an adapter that bridges the interaction between BABAM1/NBA1 and the rest of the complex, thereby being required for the complex integrity (PubMed:21282113). The BRISC complex is required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and microtubule attachment to kinetochores via its role in deubiquitinating NUMA1 (PubMed:26195665). The BRISC complex plays a role in interferon signaling via its role in the deubiquitination of the interferon receptor IFNAR1; deubiquitination increases IFNAR1 activity by enhancing its stability and cell surface expression (PubMed:24075985). Down-regulates the response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via its role in IFNAR1 deubiquitination (PubMed:24075985). May play a role in homeostasis or cellular differentiation in cells of neural, epithelial and germline origins. May also act as a death receptor-associated anti-apoptotic protein, which inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. May regulate TNF-alpha signaling through its interactions with TNFRSF1A; however these effects may be indirect (PubMed:15465831). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14636569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24075985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26195665, ECO:0000305|PubMed:15465831}.

Acts by determining HSPA8/Hsc70's ATPase and polypeptide-binding activities (PubMed:21148293). Can also act independently of HSPA8/Hsc70: together with DNAJB14, acts as a chaperone that promotes maturation of potassium channels KCND2 and KCNH2 by stabilizing nascent channel subunits and assembling them into tetramers (PubMed:27916661). While stabilization of nascent channel proteins is dependent on HSPA8/Hsc70, the process of oligomerization of channel subunits is independent of HSPA8/Hsc70 (PubMed:27916661).

Navs, also called VGSCs (voltage-gated sodium channels) or VDSCs (voltage-dependent sodium channels), operate by switching between closed and open conformations depending on the voltage difference across the membrane. In the open conformation they allow Na(+) ions to selectively pass through the pore, along their electrochemical gradient. The influx of Na+ ions provokes membrane depolarization, initiating the propagation of electrical signals throughout cells and tissues. The accessory beta subunits participate in localization and functional modulation of the Nav channels (PubMed:20558140, PubMed:21051419). Modulates the activity of SCN2A/Nav1.2, causing a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation of the channel and increasing the fraction of channels operating in the fast gating mode (By similarity). Modulates the activity of SCN5A/Nav1.5 (PubMed:20558140, PubMed:21051419, PubMed:24567321, PubMed:31950564). Could also regulate the atypical sodium channel SCN7A/Nav2.1 (PubMed:35301303).

Also acts on D-erythro-sphingosine and to a lesser extent sphinganine, but not other lipids, such as D,L-threo-dihydrosphingosine, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, diacylglycerol, ceramide, or phosphatidylinositol (PubMed:11923095, PubMed:20577214, PubMed:23602659, PubMed:24929359, PubMed:29662056). In contrast to proapoptotic SPHK2, has a negative effect on intracellular ceramide levels, enhances cell growth and inhibits apoptosis (PubMed:16118219). Involved in the regulation of inflammatory response and neuroinflammation. Via the product sphingosine 1-phosphate, stimulates TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and promotes activation of NF-kappa-B in response to TNF signaling leading to IL17 secretion (PubMed:20577214). In response to TNF and in parallel to NF-kappa-B activation, negatively regulates RANTES induction through p38 MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:23935096). Involved in endocytic membrane trafficking induced by sphingosine, recruited to dilate endosomes, also plays a role on later stages of endosomal maturation and membrane fusion independently of its kinase activity (PubMed:24929359, PubMed:28049734).

Involved in the regulation of telomere length and protection as a component of the shelterin complex (telosome). In contrast to other components of the shelterin complex, it is dispensible for telomere capping and does not participate in the protection of telomeres against non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair. Instead, it is required to negatively regulate telomere recombination and is essential for repressing homology-directed repair (HDR), which can affect telomere length. Does not bind DNA directly: recruited to telomeric double-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats via its interaction with TERF2. Independently of its function in telomeres, also acts as a transcription regulator: recruited to extratelomeric 5'-TTAGGG-3' sites via its association with TERF2 or other factors, and regulates gene expression. When cytoplasmic, associates with the I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK) complex and acts as a regulator of the NF-kappa-B signaling by promoting IKK-mediated phosphorylation of RELA/p65, leading to activate expression of NF-kappa-B target genes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16166375, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19763083}.

The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17581632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25849773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27462815}.

This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The NuA4 complex ATPase and helicase activities seem to be, at least in part, contributed by the association of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 with EP400. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when directly recruited to sites of DNA damage. As part of the SIN3B complex represses transcription and counteracts the histone acetyltransferase activity of EP300 through the recognition H3K27ac marks by PHF12 and the activity of the histone deacetylase HDAC2 (PubMed:12391155, PubMed:14966270, PubMed:37137925). SIN3B complex is recruited downstream of the constitutively active genes transcriptional start sites through interaction with histones and mitigates histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II progression within transcribed regions contributing to the regulation of transcription (PubMed:21041482).

Together with PDCD6, acts as a calcium-dependent adapter for the BCR(KLHL12) complex, a complex involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport by regulating the size of COPII coats (PubMed:27716508). In response to cytosolic calcium increase, the heterodimer formed with PDCD6 interacts with, and bridges together the BCR(KLHL12) complex and SEC31 (SEC31A or SEC31B), promoting monoubiquitination of SEC31 and subsequent collagen export, which is required for neural crest specification (PubMed:27716508). Its role in the heterodimer formed with PDCD6 is however unclear: some evidence shows that PEF1 and PDCD6 work together and promote association between PDCD6 and SEC31 in presence of calcium (PubMed:27716508). Other reports show that PEF1 dissociates from PDCD6 in presence of calcium, and may act as a negative regulator of PDCD6 (PubMed:11278427). Also acts as a negative regulator of ER-Golgi transport; possibly by inhibiting interaction between PDCD6 and SEC31 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q641Z8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27716508}.

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Selectively binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 in preference to other phosphoinositides tested. Involved in late stages of cytokinesis.

Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A forming an intermediate. Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP. STRAP plays a role in the cellular distribution of the SMN complex. Negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling but positively regulates the PDPK1 kinase activity by enhancing its autophosphorylation and by significantly reducing the association of PDPK1 with 14-3-3 protein. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161}.

Isoform 1 and isoform 2 positively regulate the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by enhancing the sumoylation of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA), promoting its stabilization which consequently leads to an increased inhibition of NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 negatively regulate the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A) signaling pathway by increasing the sumoylation of HIF1A, promoting its stabilization, transcriptional activity and the expression of its target gene VEGFA during hypoxia.

Q9Y4L5	RN115_HUMAN	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF115 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 115) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RNF115) (Rab7-interacting RING finger protein) (Rabring 7) (Zinc finger protein 364)	Homo sapiens (Human)	304	metal ion binding [GO:0046872]; ubiquitin protein ligase activity [GO:0061630]; ubiquitin-protein transferase activity [GO:0004842]	FUNCTION: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that catalyzes the 'Lys-48'- and/or 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of various substrates and thereby plays a role in a number of signaling pathways including autophagy, innate immunity, cell proliferation and cell death (PubMed:20019814, PubMed:30689267). Plays a role in the endosomal trafficking and degradation of membrane receptors including EGFR, FLT3, MET and CXCR4 through their polyubiquitination. Participates together with BST2 in antiviral immunity by facilitating the internalization of HIV-1 virions into intracellular vesicles leading to their lysosomal degradation (PubMed:20019814). Possesses also an antiviral activity independently of BST2 by promoting retroviral GAG proteins ubiquitination, redistribution to endo-lysosomal compartments and, ultimately, lysosomal degradation (PubMed:24852021). Catalyzes distinct types of ubiquitination on MAVS and STING1 at different phases of viral infection to promote innate antiviral response (PubMed:33139700). Mediates the 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of MAVS leading to its proteasomal degradation and ubiquitinates STING1 via 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination, critical for its oligomerization and the subsequent recruitment of TBK1 (PubMed:33139700). Plays a positive role in the autophagosome-lysosome fusion by interacting with STX17 and enhancing its stability without affecting 'Lys-48'- or 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination levels, which in turn promotes autophagosome maturation (PubMed:32980859). Negatively regulates TLR-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines by catalyzing 'Lys-11'-linked ubiquitination of RAB1A and RAB13 to inhibit post-ER trafficking of TLRs to the Golgi by RAB1A and subsequently from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface by RAB13 (PubMed:35343654). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16288031, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18819927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20019814, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24852021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32980859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33139700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35343654, ECO:0000303|PubMed:23418353}.

Required for canonical autophagy (macroautophagy), non-canonical autophagy as well as for mitophagy (PubMed:33773106, PubMed:33909989). The protease activity is required for proteolytic activation of ATG8 family proteins: cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 proteins MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B, MAP1LC3C, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2 and GABARAP, to reveal a C-terminal glycine (PubMed:15169837, PubMed:15187094, PubMed:17347651, PubMed:19322194, PubMed:20818167, PubMed:21177865, PubMed:22302004, PubMed:27527864, PubMed:28287329, PubMed:28633005, PubMed:29458288, PubMed:30661429). Exposure of the glycine at the C-terminus is essential for ATG8 proteins conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and insertion to membranes, which is necessary for autophagy (PubMed:15169837, PubMed:15187094, PubMed:17347651, PubMed:19322194, PubMed:21177865, PubMed:22302004). Protease activity is also required to counteract formation of high-molecular weight conjugates of ATG8 proteins (ATG8ylation): acts as a deubiquitinating-like enzyme that removes ATG8 conjugated to other proteins, such as ATG3 (PubMed:31315929, PubMed:33773106). In addition to the protease activity, also mediates delipidation of ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:15187094, PubMed:19322194, PubMed:28633005, PubMed:29458288, PubMed:32686895, PubMed:33909989). Catalyzes delipidation of PE-conjugated forms of ATG8 proteins during macroautophagy (PubMed:15187094, PubMed:19322194, PubMed:29458288, PubMed:32686895, PubMed:33909989). Also involved in non-canonical autophagy, a parallel pathway involving conjugation of ATG8 proteins to single membranes at endolysosomal compartments, by catalyzing delipidation of ATG8 proteins conjugated to phosphatidylserine (PS) (PubMed:33909989). Compared to other members of the family (ATG4A, ATG4C or ATG4C), constitutes the major protein for proteolytic activation of ATG8 proteins, while it displays weaker delipidation activity than other ATG4 paralogs (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:30661429). Involved in phagophore growth during mitophagy independently of its protease activity and of ATG8 proteins: acts by regulating ATG9A trafficking to mitochondria and promoting phagophore-endoplasmic reticulum contacts during the lipid transfer phase of mitophagy (PubMed:33773106). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15169837, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15187094, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17347651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19322194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20818167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21177865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22302004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26378241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27527864, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28287329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28633005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28821708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29232556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29458288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30076329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30443548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30661429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31315929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32686895, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33773106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33909989}.

Cyanocobalamin constitutes the inactive form of vitamin B12 introduced from the diet, and is converted into the active cofactors methylcobalamin (MeCbl) involved in methionine biosynthesis, and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) involved in the TCA cycle (PubMed:19801555). Forms a complex with the lysosomal transporter ABCD4 and its chaperone LMBRD1, to transport cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane into the cytosol (PubMed:25535791). The processing of cobalamin in the cytosol occurs in a multiprotein complex composed of at least MMACHC, MMADHC, MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) and MTR (methionine synthase) which may contribute to shuttle safely and efficiently cobalamin towards MTR in order to produce methionine (PubMed:21071249, PubMed:27771510). Also acts as a glutathione transferase by catalyzing the dealkylation of the alkylcob(III)alamins MeCbl and AdoCbl, using the thiolate of glutathione for nucleophilic displacement to generate cob(I)alamin and the corresponding glutathione thioether (PubMed:19801555, PubMed:21697092, PubMed:22642810, PubMed:25809485). The conversion of incoming MeCbl or AdoCbl into a common intermediate cob(I)alamin is necessary to meet the cellular needs for both cofactors (PubMed:19801555).

The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase produces dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate/Dol-P-Glc, the glucose donor substrate used sequentially by ALG6, ALG8 and ALG10 to add glucose residues on top of the Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol structure. These are the three last steps in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides to produce Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol.
