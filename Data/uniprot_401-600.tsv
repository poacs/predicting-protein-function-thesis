Binds specifically and directly to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin.

May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles (PubMed:11535615, PubMed:12399544, PubMed:12446774, PubMed:14559997, PubMed:14988723, PubMed:15311285, PubMed:15650047, PubMed:15665856). This regulation is achieved by a number of mechanisms that together help to preserve the integrity of the genome (PubMed:11535615, PubMed:12399544, PubMed:12446774, PubMed:14559997, PubMed:14988723, PubMed:15311285, PubMed:15650047, PubMed:15665856). Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [R-X-X-S/T] (PubMed:11535615, PubMed:12399544, PubMed:12446774, PubMed:14559997, PubMed:14988723, PubMed:15311285, PubMed:15650047, PubMed:15665856).

Phosphorylation of CDC25A at 'Ser-178' and 'Thr-507' and phosphorylation of CDC25C at 'Ser-216' creates binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins which inhibit CDC25A and CDC25C (PubMed:9278511). Phosphorylation of CDC25A at 'Ser-76', 'Ser-124', 'Ser-178', 'Ser-279' and 'Ser-293' promotes proteolysis of CDC25A (PubMed:12676583, PubMed:12676925, PubMed:12759351, PubMed:14681206, PubMed:19734889, PubMed:9278511). Phosphorylation of CDC25A at 'Ser-76' primes the protein for subsequent phosphorylation at 'Ser-79', 'Ser-82' and 'Ser-88' by NEK11, which is required for polyubiquitination and degradation of CDCD25A (PubMed:19734889, PubMed:20090422, PubMed:9278511). Inhibition of CDC25 leads to increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes and blocks cell cycle progression (PubMed:9278511). Also phosphorylates NEK6 (PubMed:18728393). Binds to and phosphorylates RAD51 at 'Thr-309', which promotes the release of RAD51 from BRCA2 and enhances the association of RAD51 with chromatin, thereby promoting DNA repair by homologous recombination (PubMed:15665856). Phosphorylates multiple sites within the C-terminus of TP53, which promotes activation of TP53 by acetylation and promotes cell cycle arrest and suppression of cellular proliferation (PubMed:10673501, PubMed:15659650, PubMed:16511572). Also promotes repair of DNA cross-links through phosphorylation of FANCE (PubMed:17296736). Binds to and phosphorylates TLK1 at 'Ser-743', which prevents the TLK1-dependent phosphorylation of the chromatin assembly factor ASF1A (PubMed:12660173, PubMed:12955071). This may enhance chromatin assembly both in the presence or absence of DNA damage (PubMed:12660173, PubMed:12955071). May also play a role in replication fork maintenance through regulation of PCNA (PubMed:18451105). May regulate the transcription of genes that regulate cell-cycle progression through the phosphorylation of histones (By similarity). Phosphorylates histone H3.1 (to form H3T11ph), which leads to epigenetic inhibition of a subset of genes (By similarity). May also phosphorylate RB1 to promote its interaction with the E2F family of transcription factors and subsequent cell cycle arrest (PubMed:17380128). Phosphorylates SPRTN, promoting SPRTN recruitment to chromatin (PubMed:31316063). Reduces replication stress and activates the G2/M checkpoint, by phosphorylating and inactivating PABIR1/FAM122A and promoting the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation and stabilization of WEE1 levels and activity (PubMed:33108758). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10673501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11535615, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12399544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12446774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12660173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12759351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12955071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14559997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14681206, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15311285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15650047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15659650, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15665856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16511572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296736, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17380128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18451105, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18728393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19734889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20090422, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31316063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32357935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33108758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9278511}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Endogenous repressor of isoform 1, interacts with, and antagonizes CHK1 to promote the S to G2/M phase transition. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22184239}.

Binds specifically and directly to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Mediates nuclear import of STAT1 homodimers and STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers by recognizing non-classical NLSs of STAT1 and STAT2 through ARM repeats 8-9.

Cross-antagonism between ZBTB7B and CBF complexes are determinative to CD4 versus CD8 cell fate decision. Suppresses RUNX3 expression and imposes CD4+ lineage fate by inducing the SOCS suppressors of cytokine signaling. induces, as a transcriptional activator, SOCS genes expression which represses RUNX3 expression and promotes the CD4+ lineage fate. During CD4 lineage commitment, associates with multiple sites at the CD8 locus, acting as a negative regulator of the CD8 promoter and enhancers by epigenetic silencing through the recruitment of class II histone deacetylases, such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, to these loci. Regulates the development of IL17-producing CD1d-restricted naural killer (NK) T cells. Also functions as an important metabolic regulator in the lactating mammary glands.

Hydrophobicity is a major requirement for recognition in polyvalent substrates and inhibitors (By similarity). Primarily expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and proximal tubules and involved in the uptake and disposition of cationic compounds by hepatic and renal clearance from the blood flow (By similarity). Most likely functions as an uptake carrier in enterocytes contributing to the intestinal elimination of organic cations from the systemic circulation (PubMed:16263091). Transports endogenous monoamines such as N-1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), guanidine, histamine, neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline (PubMed:12439218, PubMed:24961373, PubMed:35469921, PubMed:9260930). Also transports natural polyamines such as spermidine, agmatine and putrescine at low affinity, but relatively high turnover (PubMed:21128598). Involved in the hepatic uptake of vitamin B1/thiamine, hence regulating hepatic lipid and energy metabolism (PubMed:24961373). Mediates the bidirectional transport of acetylcholine (ACh) at the apical membrane of ciliated cell in airway epithelium, thereby playing a role in luminal release of ACh from bronchial epithelium (PubMed:15817714). Transports dopaminergic neuromodulators cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol with lower efficency (PubMed:17460754). Also capable of transporting non-amine endogenous compounds such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha) (PubMed:11907186). May contribute to the transport of cationic compounds in testes across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable).

The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:18599441, PubMed:25849773). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). In the eIF-3 complex, EIF3D specifically recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine cap of a subset of mRNAs (PubMed:27462815). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18599441, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25849773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27462815}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of FCV infection, plays a role in the ribosomal termination-reinitiation event leading to the translation of VP2 (PubMed:18056426). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18056426}.

Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events (PubMed:23911289). Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes, such as N-Cor repressor complex, which activate the histone deacetylase activity (PubMed:23911289, PubMed:22230954). Participates in the BCL6 transcriptional repressor activity by deacetylating the H3 'Lys-27' (H3K27) on enhancer elements, antagonizing EP300 acetyltransferase activity and repressing proximal gene expression (PubMed:23911289). Acts as a molecular chaperone for shuttling phosphorylated NR2C1 to PML bodies for sumoylation (By similarity). Contributes, together with XBP1 isoform 1, to the activation of NFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in a PI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading to endothelial cell (EC) survival under disturbed flow/oxidative stress (PubMed:25190803). Regulates both the transcriptional activation and repression phases of the circadian clock in a deacetylase activity-independent manner (By similarity). During the activation phase, promotes the accumulation of ubiquitinated BMAL1 at the E-boxes and during the repression phase, blocks FBXL3-mediated CRY1/2 ubiquitination and promotes the interaction of CRY1 and BMAL1 (By similarity). The NCOR1-HDAC3 complex regulates the circadian expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 and the genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver (By similarity). Also functions as a deacetylase for non-histone targets, such as KAT5, MEF2D, MAPK14, RARA and STAT3 (PubMed:15653507, PubMed:21030595, PubMed:21444723, PubMed:25301942, PubMed:28167758). Serves as a corepressor of RARA, mediating its deacetylation and repression, leading to inhibition of RARE DNA element binding (PubMed:28167758). In association with RARA, plays a role in the repression of microRNA-10a and thereby in the inflammatory response (PubMed:28167758). In addition to protein deacetylase activity, also acts as a protein-lysine deacylase by recognizing other acyl groups: catalyzes removal of (2E)-butenoyl (crotonyl), lactoyl (lactyl) and 2-hydroxyisobutanoyl (2-hydroxyisobutyryl) acyl groups from lysine residues, leading to protein decrotonylation, delactylation and de-2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, respectively (PubMed:28497810, PubMed:29192674, PubMed:34608293, PubMed:35044827). Catalyzes decrotonylation of MAPRE1/EB1 (PubMed:34608293).

Also weakly methylates histone H1 (in vitro). H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting HP1 (CBX1, CBX3 and/or CBX5) proteins to methylated histones. Mainly functions in heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin at pericentric and telomere regions. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation is also required to direct DNA methylation at pericentric repeats. SUV39H1 is targeted to histone H3 via its interaction with RB1 and is involved in many processes, such as repression of MYOD1-stimulated differentiation, regulation of the control switch for exiting the cell cycle and entering differentiation, repression by the PML-RARA fusion protein, BMP-induced repression, repression of switch recombination to IgA and regulation of telomere length. Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. Recruited by the large PER complex to the E-box elements of the circadian target genes such as PER2 itself or PER1, contributes to the conversion of local chromatin to a heterochromatin-like repressive state through H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14765126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16449642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16818776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18004385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18485871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30111536}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Plays a role in defense against mycobacterial infections.

Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs) autophosphorylate a critical tyrosine residue in their activation loop and phosphorylate their substrate on serine and threonine residues (PubMed:29634919, PubMed:9748265). Acts as a central dissolvase of membraneless organelles during the G2-to-M transition, after the nuclear-envelope breakdown: acts by mediating phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in unstructured domains of proteins, such as SRRM1 and PCM1 (PubMed:29973724). Does not mediate disassembly of all membraneless organelles: disassembly of P-body and nucleolus is not regulated by DYRK3 (PubMed:29973724). Dissolution of membraneless organelles at the onset of mitosis is also required to release mitotic regulators, such as ZNF207, from liquid-unmixed organelles where they are sequestered and keep them dissolved during mitosis (PubMed:29973724). Regulates mTORC1 by mediating the dissolution of stress granules: during stressful conditions, DYRK3 partitions from the cytosol to the stress granule, together with mTORC1 components, which prevents mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:23415227). When stress signals are gone, the kinase activity of DYRK3 is required for the dissolution of stress granule and mTORC1 relocation to the cytosol: acts by mediating the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 inhibitor AKT1S1, allowing full reactivation of mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:23415227). Also acts as a negative regulator of EPO-dependent erythropoiesis: may place an upper limit on red cell production during stress erythropoiesis (PubMed:10779429). Inhibits cell death due to cytokine withdrawal in hematopoietic progenitor cells (PubMed:10779429).

Regulates ITPR1 sensitivity to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, competing for the common binding site and acting as endogenous 'pseudoligand' whose inhibitory activity can be modulated by its phosphorylation status. Promotes the formation of contact points between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, facilitating transfer of Ca(2+) from the ER to mitochondria (PubMed:27995898). Under normal cellular conditions, functions cooperatively with BCL2L10 to limit ITPR1-mediated Ca(2+) release but, under apoptotic stress conditions, dephosphorylated which promotes dissociation of both AHCYL1 and BCL2L10 from mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, inhibits BCL2L10 interaction with ITPR1 and leads to increased Ca(2+) transfer to mitochondria which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:27995898). In the pancreatic and salivary ducts, at resting state, attenuates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release by interacting with ITPR1 (PubMed:16793548). When extracellular stimuli induce ITPR1 phosphorylation or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, dissociates from ITPR1 to interact with CFTR and SLC26A6, mediating their synergistic activation by calcium and cAMP that stimulates the epithelial secretion of electrolytes and fluid (By similarity). Also activates basolateral SLC4A4 isoform 1 to coordinate fluid and HCO3(-) secretion (PubMed:16769890). Inhibits the effect of STK39 on SLC4A4 and CFTR by recruiting PP1 phosphatase which activates SLC4A4, SLC26A6 and CFTR through dephosphorylation (By similarity). Mediates the induction of SLC9A3 surface expression produced by Angiotensin-2 (PubMed:20584908). Depending on the cell type, activates SLC9A3 in response to calcium or reverses SLC9A3R2-dependent calcium inhibition (PubMed:18829453). May modulate the polyadenylation state of specific mRNAs, both by controlling the subcellular location of FIP1L1 and by inhibiting PAPOLA activity, in response to a stimulus that alters its phosphorylation state (PubMed:19224921). Acts as a (dATP)-dependent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase large subunit RRM1, controlling the endogenous dNTP pool and ensuring normal cell cycle progression (PubMed:25237103).

Regulates the production of CCR4 and CCR7 ligands in medullary thymic epithelial cells and alters the coordinated maturation and migration of thymocytes. In thimic B-cells, allows the presentation of licensing-dependent endogenous self-anitgen for negative selection. In secondary lymphoid organs, induces functional inactivation of CD4(+) T-cells.

Mediates monoubiquitination as well as 'Lys-6', 'Lys-11', 'Lys-48'-linked and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of substrates depending on the context (PubMed:19229105, PubMed:20889974, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:25621951, PubMed:32047033). Participates in the removal and/or detoxification of abnormally folded or damaged protein by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins such as PARK7: 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins are then recognized by HDAC6, leading to their recruitment to aggresomes, followed by degradation (PubMed:17846173, PubMed:19229105). Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of a 22 kDa O-linked glycosylated isoform of SNCAIP, possibly playing a role in Lewy-body formation (PubMed:11431533, PubMed:11590439, PubMed:15105460, PubMed:15728840, PubMed:19229105). Mediates monoubiquitination of BCL2, thereby acting as a positive regulator of autophagy (PubMed:20889974). Protects against mitochondrial dysfunction during cellular stress, by acting downstream of PINK1 to coordinate mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove and replace dysfunctional mitochondrial components (PubMed:11439185, PubMed:18957282, PubMed:19029340, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:21376232, PubMed:22082830, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32047033). Depending on the severity of mitochondrial damage and/or dysfunction, activity ranges from preventing apoptosis and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis to regulating mitochondrial dynamics and eliminating severely damaged mitochondria via mitophagy (PubMed:11439185, PubMed:19029340, PubMed:19801972, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:21376232, PubMed:22082830, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23685073, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32047033, PubMed:33499712). Activation and recruitment onto the outer membrane of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria (OMM) requires PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of both PRKN and ubiquitin (PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:25527291). After mitochondrial damage, functions with PINK1 to mediate the decision between mitophagy or preventing apoptosis by inducing either the poly- or monoubiquitination of VDAC1, respectively; polyubiquitination of VDAC1 promotes mitophagy, while monoubiquitination of VDAC1 decreases mitochondrial calcium influx which ultimately inhibits apoptosis (PubMed:27534820, PubMed:32047033). When cellular stress results in irreversible mitochondrial damage, promotes the autophagic degradation of dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria (mitophagy) by promoting the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins such as TOMM20, RHOT1/MIRO1, MFN1 and USP30 (PubMed:19029340, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:21753002, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23685073, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:25527291). Preferentially assembles 'Lys-6'-, 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, leading to mitophagy (PubMed:25621951, PubMed:32047033). The PINK1-PRKN pathway also promotes fission of damaged mitochondria by PINK1-mediated phosphorylation which promotes the PRKN-dependent degradation of mitochondrial proteins involved in fission such as MFN2 (PubMed:23620051). This prevents the refusion of unhealthy mitochondria with the mitochondrial network or initiates mitochondrial fragmentation facilitating their later engulfment by autophagosomes (PubMed:23620051). Regulates motility of damaged mitochondria via the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MIRO1 and MIRO2; in motor neurons, this likely inhibits mitochondrial intracellular anterograde transport along the axons which probably increases the chance of the mitochondria undergoing mitophagy in the soma (PubMed:22396657). Involved in mitochondrial biogenesis via the 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of transcriptional repressor ZNF746/PARIS which leads to its subsequent proteasomal degradation and allows activation of the transcription factor PPARGC1A (PubMed:21376232). Limits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:18541373). Regulates cyclin-E during neuronal apoptosis (PubMed:12628165). In collaboration with CHPF isoform 2, may enhance cell viability and protect cells from oxidative stress (PubMed:22082830). Independently of its ubiquitin ligase activity, protects from apoptosis by the transcriptional repression of p53/TP53 (PubMed:19801972).

Both pathways seem to involve interactions with G-proteins. Activation by WNT8 induces expression of beta-catenin target genes (By similarity). Following ligand activation, binds to CCDC88C/DAPLE which displaces DVL1 from FZD7 and leads to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, activation of G-proteins by CCDC88C and triggering of non-canonical Wnt responses (PubMed:26126266).

Following DNA DSBs, it is recruited to the sites of damage by ATM-phosphorylated MDC1 and catalyzes the 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, thereby promoting the formation of TP53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) (PubMed:18001824, PubMed:18006705). Also controls the recruitment of UIMC1-BRCC3 (RAP80-BRCC36) and PAXIP1/PTIP to DNA damage sites (PubMed:18077395, PubMed:19202061). Promotes the recruitment of NBN to DNA damage sites by catalyzing 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of NBN (PubMed:23115235). Also recruited at DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) sites and catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, leading to recruitment of FAAP20/C1orf86 and Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, followed by interstrand cross-link repair. H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Promotes the formation of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interactions with the specific ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2N/UBC13 and ubiquitinates non-histone substrates such as PCNA. Substrates that are polyubiquitinated at 'Lys-63' are usually not targeted for degradation. Also catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2L6/UBCH8, leading to degradation of substrate proteins such as CHEK2, JMJD2A/KDM4A and KU80/XRCC5: it is still unclear how the preference toward 'Lys-48'- versus 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination is regulated but it could be due to RNF8 ability to interact with specific E2 specific ligases. For instance, interaction with phosphorylated HERC2 promotes the association between RNF8 and UBE2N/UBC13 and favors the specific formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains. Promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by promoting the 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination and degradation the of KU80/XRCC5. Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of JMJD2A/KDM4A in collaboration with RNF168, leading to unmask H4K20me2 mark and promote the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites (PubMed:11322894, PubMed:14981089, PubMed:17724460, PubMed:18001825, PubMed:18337245, PubMed:18948756, PubMed:19015238, PubMed:19124460, PubMed:19203578, PubMed:19203579, PubMed:20550933, PubMed:21558560, PubMed:21857671, PubMed:21911360, PubMed:22266820, PubMed:22373579, PubMed:22531782, PubMed:22705371, PubMed:22980979). Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of POLD4/p12, a subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In the absence of POLD4, DNA polymerase delta complex exhibits higher proofreading activity (PubMed:23233665). In addition to its function in damage signaling, also plays a role in higher-order chromatin structure by mediating extensive chromatin decondensation. Involved in the activation of ATM by promoting histone H2B ubiquitination, which indirectly triggers histone H4 'Lys-16' acetylation (H4K16ac), establishing a chromatin environment that promotes efficient activation of ATM kinase. Required in the testis, where it plays a role in the replacement of histones during spermatogenesis. At uncapped telomeres, promotes the joining of deprotected chromosome ends by inducing H2A ubiquitination and TP53BP1 recruitment, suggesting that it may enhance cancer development by aggravating telomere-induced genome instability in case of telomeric crisis. Promotes the assembly of RAD51 at DNA DSBs in the absence of BRCA1 and TP53BP1 Also involved in class switch recombination in immune system, via its role in regulation of DSBs repair (PubMed:22865450).

O94788	AL1A2_HUMAN	Retinal dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH 2) (RalDH2) (EC 1.2.1.36) (Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A2) (ALDH1A2) (Retinaldehyde-specific dehydrogenase type 2) (RALDH(II))	Homo sapiens (Human)	518	3-chloroallyl aldehyde dehydrogenase activity [GO:0004028]; aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity [GO:0004029]; retinal binding [GO:0016918]; retinal dehydrogenase activity [GO:0001758]	FUNCTION: Catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of aldehyde substrates, such as all-trans-retinal and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinal, to their corresponding carboxylic acids, all-trans-retinoate and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoate, respectively (PubMed:29240402, PubMed:33565183). Retinoate signaling is critical for the transcriptional control of many genes, for instance it is crucial for initiation of meiosis in both male and female (Probable) (PubMed:33565183). Recognizes retinal as substrate, both in its free form and when bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (By similarity).

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Belongs to the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex), as such plays a role in remodeling mononucleosomes in an ATP-dependent fashion, and is required for postmitotic neural development and dendritic outgrowth. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. ACTL6B/BAF53B is not essential for assembly of the nBAF complex but is required for targeting the complex and CREST to the promoter of genes essential for dendritic growth (By similarity). Essential for neuronal maturation and dendrite development (PubMed:31031012). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q99MR0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31031012, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.

Voltage sensing is coupled to K(+) electrochemical gradient in an 'ion flux gating' mode where outward but not inward ion flow opens the gate. Converts to voltage-independent 'leak' conductance mode upon stimulation by various stimuli including mechanical membrane stretch, acidic pH, heat and lipids. Reversibly converts between a voltage-insensitive K(+) 'leak' channel and a voltage-dependent outward rectifying K(+) channel in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (By similarity) (PubMed:10321245, PubMed:10784345, PubMed:11319556, PubMed:23169818, PubMed:30573346, PubMed:38605031). Homo- and heterodimerizes to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties (By similarity). In trigeminal ganglia sensory neurons, the heterodimer of KCNK2/TREK-1 and KCNK18/TRESK inhibits neuronal firing and neurogenic inflammation by stabilizing the resting membrane potential at K(+) equilibrium potential as well as by regulating the threshold of action potentials and the spike frequency (By similarity). At trigeminal A-beta afferent nerves, the heterodimer of KCNK2/TREK-1 and KCNK4/TRAAK is mostly coexpressed at nodes of Ranvier where it conducts voltage-independent mechanosensitive and thermosensitive currents, allowing rapid action potential repolarization, high speed and high frequence saltatory conduction on myelinated nerves to ensure prompt sensory responses (By similarity). In hippocampal astrocytes, the heterodimer of KCNK2/TREK-1 and KCNK1/TWIK-1 allows passive K(+) conductance under basal conditions, but changes ion selectivity and becomes permeable to L-glutamate and Cl(-) ions upon binding to G-protein subunit GNG4 in stimulated astrocytes. Mediates rapid L-glutamate release in response to activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, such as F2R and CNR1 (By similarity). In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, the homodimer of KCNK2/TREK-1 contributes to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B-induced slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Associates with AKAP5 and Gs-protein-coupled receptor B2AR at postsynaptic dense bodies and converts to a leak channel no longer sensitive to stimulation by arachidonic acid, acidic pH or mechanical stress, nor inhibited by Gq-coupled receptors but still under the negative control of Gs-coupled receptors (By similarity).

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Required for maximal ATPase activity of SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A and for association of the SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A containing remodeling complex BAF with chromatin/nuclear matrix. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and is required for the proliferation of neural progenitors. During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when recruited to sites of DNA damage.

Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268). {ECO:0000303|PubMed:17576170, ECO:0000303|PubMed:20176268, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22158414}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Constant region of secreted IgE, also known as the Fc region of IgE antibody. Mediates IgE effector functions on myeloid and lymphoid cells primarily via two Fc receptors, the high-affinity IgE Fc receptor complex/FCER1A:MS4A2:FCGR1A and the low-affinity FCER2 receptor, which upon antigen/allergen cross-linking initiate signaling pathways that lead to immune cell activation and differentiation (PubMed:2167225, PubMed:25629393, PubMed:33840121, PubMed:7544003, PubMed:8114916, PubMed:8551243). Triggers the immediate hypersensitivity response to allergens as a host defense mechanism against helminth parasites, pathogenic bacteria and venom toxicity. When dysregulated, it can elicit harmful life-threatening allergic and anaphylactic reactions (PubMed:25629393, PubMed:33840121, PubMed:7544003, PubMed:8114916, PubMed:8551243). Stimulates the high-affinity IgE Fc receptor complex/FCER1A:MS4A2:FCGR1A on mast cells, basophils and eosinophils leading to secretion of vasoactive amines, lipid mediators and cytokines that contribute to inflammatory response, tissue remodeling and cytotoxicity against microbes (PubMed:25629393, PubMed:8114916, PubMed:8551243). On macrophages, cross-linking of FCER2 by IgE immune complexes induces intracellular killing of parasites through activation of L-Arginine-nitric oxide pathway (PubMed:7544003). Activates macrophages to kill tumor cells via antigen-specific antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Triggers differentiation of quiescent M0 macrophages toward M1 state and reprograms M2 macrophages toward a proinflammatory state with antitumor functions (PubMed:30956175). Stimulates FCER2 on B cells and initiates IgE-dependent antigen uptake and presentation to T cells (PubMed:2167225). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:2167225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25629393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30956175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33840121, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7544003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8114916, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8551243, ECO:0000303|PubMed:20176268, ECO:0000305|PubMed:10917520, ECO:0000305|PubMed:7995941}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Constant region of membrane-bound IgE (long mIgE), part of the B cell receptor complex (BCR).

Able to multimerize, forms high order polymers, mainly pentamers and occasionally hexamers, providing for multivalency and high avidity recognition of antigens (PubMed:32029689, PubMed:37095205). Natural sIgM are polyreactive and recognize conserved self- and pathogen-derived structures, whereas immune sIgM are secreted only upon exposure to pathogens and are antigen-specific. Both natural and immune sIgM are required for an efficient humoral immune response to infection (By similarity). Mediates sIgM effector functions mostly via Fc receptors and the complement system. On lymphoid cells binds high-affinity Fc receptor FCMR and promotes induction of an efficient neutralizing IgG response while maintaining tolerance to self-antigens. Recruits C1q complement component to initiate the classical complement pathway, facilitating the recognition and neutralization of pathogens by the host. Together with C1q and mannose-binding lectin promotes the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages, ensuring the clearance of potential autoimmune epitopes from tissues (By similarity) (PubMed:12847249, PubMed:19006321, PubMed:28230186, PubMed:32029689).

IgD is the major antigen receptor isotype on the surface of most peripheral B-cells, where it is coexpressed with IgM. The membrane-bound IgD (mIgD) induces the phosphorylation of CD79A and CD79B by the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases. Soluble IgD (sIgD) concentration in serum below those of IgG, IgA, and IgM but much higher than that of IgE. IgM and IgD molecules present on B cells have identical V regions and antigen-binding sites. After the antigen binds to the B-cell receptor, the secreted form sIgD is shut off. IgD is a potent inducer of TNF, IL1B, and IL1RN. IgD also induces release of IL6, IL10, and LIF from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

The steroid hormones and their receptors are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and affect cellular proliferation and differentiation in target tissues. Ligand-dependent nuclear transactivation involves either direct homodimer binding to a palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) sequence or association with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AP-1/c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, Sp1 and Sp3, to mediate ERE-independent signaling. Ligand binding induces a conformational change allowing subsequent or combinatorial association with multiprotein coactivator complexes through LXXLL motifs of their respective components. Mutual transrepression occurs between the estrogen receptor (ER) and NF-kappa-B in a cell-type specific manner. Decreases NF-kappa-B DNA-binding activity and inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription from the IL6 promoter and displace RELA/p65 and associated coregulators from the promoter. Recruited to the NF-kappa-B response element of the CCL2 and IL8 promoters and can displace CREBBP. Present with NF-kappa-B components RELA/p65 and NFKB1/p50 on ERE sequences. Can also act synergistically with NF-kappa-B to activate transcription involving respective recruitment adjacent response elements; the function involves CREBBP.

Through the production of ceramides, participates in the PKC-activated salvage pathway of ceramide formation (PubMed:19279011). Catalyzes the glucosylation of cholesterol, through a transglucosylation reaction where glucose is transferred from GlcCer to cholesterol (PubMed:24211208, PubMed:26724485, PubMed:32144204). GlcCer containing mono-unsaturated fatty acids (such as beta-D-glucosyl-N-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sphing-4-enine) are preferred as glucose donors for cholesterol glucosylation when compared with GlcCer containing same chain length of saturated fatty acids (such as beta-D-glucosyl-N-octadecanoyl-sphing-4-enine) (PubMed:24211208). Under specific conditions, may alternatively catalyze the reverse reaction, transferring glucose from cholesteryl 3-beta-D-glucoside to ceramide (Probable) (PubMed:26724485). Can also hydrolyze cholesteryl 3-beta-D-glucoside producing glucose and cholesterol (PubMed:24211208, PubMed:26724485).

This process can be regulated by the presence of certain HRG ligands such as heparin and zinc ions. Binds to IgG subclasses of immunoglobins containing kappa and lambda light chains with different affinities regulating their clearance and inhibiting the formation of insoluble immune complexes. Tethers plasminogen to the cell surface. Binds T-cells and alters the cell morphology. Modulates angiogenesis by blocking the CD6-mediated antiangiongenic effect of thrombospondins, THBS1 and THBS2. Acts as a regulator of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway; inhibits endothelial cell motility by reducing VEGF-induced complex formation between PXN/paxillin and ILK/integrin-linked protein kinase and by promoting inhibition of VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinases and alpha-actinins in endothelial cells. Also plays a role in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and tumor immune surveillance. Normalizes tumor vessels and promotes antitumor immunity by polarizing tumor-associated macrophages, leading to decreased tumor growth and metastasis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11134179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12235005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14744774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15220341, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15313924, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16436387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16489009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19285951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19535045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19712047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19903770, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20573803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21215706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21304106}.

Has broad substrate specificity and can hydrolyze a considerable variety of compounds: however, only a few substrates, such as diphosphate (inorganic pyrophosphate; PPi), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and N-phosphocreatine are natural substrates (PubMed:12162492, PubMed:2220817). Plays an essential role in skeletal and dental mineralization via its ability to hydrolyze extracellular diphosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor, to phosphate: it thereby promotes hydroxyapatite crystal formation and increases inorganic phosphate concentration (PubMed:23688511, PubMed:25982064). Acts in a non-redundant manner with PHOSPHO1 in skeletal mineralization: while PHOSPHO1 mediates the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the matrix vesicles (MVs), ALPL/TNAP catalyzes the spread of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Also promotes dephosphorylation of osteopontin (SSP1), an inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystallization in its phosphorylated state; it is however unclear whether ALPL/TNAP mediates SSP1 dephosphorylation via a direct or indirect manner (By similarity). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of PLP to pyridoxal (PL), the transportable form of vitamin B6, in order to provide a sufficient amount of PLP in the brain, an essential cofactor for enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of diverse neurotransmitters (PubMed:20049532, PubMed:2220817). Additionally, also able to mediate ATP degradation in a stepwise manner to adenosine, thereby regulating the availability of ligands for purinergic receptors (By similarity). Also capable of dephosphorylating microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as well as other phosphorylated small-molecules, such as poly-inosine:cytosine (poly I:C) (PubMed:28448526). Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating hydrolysis of N-phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation (By similarity). During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P09242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12162492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20049532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2220817, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23688511, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25982064, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28448526}.

Plays a key role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-linked signal transduction pathways. Constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic portions of the CD4 and CD8 surface receptors. Association of the TCR with a peptide antigen-bound MHC complex facilitates the interaction of CD4 and CD8 with MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, thereby recruiting the associated LCK protein to the vicinity of the TCR/CD3 complex. LCK then phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-gamma chains and CD3 subunits, initiating the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway. Once stimulated, the TCR recruits the tyrosine kinase ZAP70, that becomes phosphorylated and activated by LCK. Following this, a large number of signaling molecules are recruited, ultimately leading to lymphokine production. LCK also contributes to signaling by other receptor molecules. Associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, which leads to hyperphosphorylation and activation of LCK. Also plays a role in the IL2 receptor-linked signaling pathway that controls the T-cell proliferative response. Binding of IL2 to its receptor results in increased activity of LCK. Is expressed at all stages of thymocyte development and is required for the regulation of maturation events that are governed by both pre-TCR and mature alpha beta TCR.

Binds to IL6 with low affinity, but does not transduce a signal (PubMed:28265003). Signal activation necessitate an association with IL6ST. Activation leads to the regulation of the immune response, acute-phase reactions and hematopoiesis (PubMed:30995492, PubMed:31235509). The interaction with membrane-bound IL6R and IL6ST stimulates 'classic signaling', the restricted expression of the IL6R limits classic IL6 signaling to only a few tissues such as the liver and some cells of the immune system. Whereas the binding of IL6 and soluble IL6R to IL6ST stimulates 'trans-signaling'. Alternatively, 'cluster signaling' occurs when membrane-bound IL6:IL6R complexes on transmitter cells activate IL6ST receptors on neighboring receiver cells (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28265003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31235509, ECO:0000305|PubMed:30995492}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Signaling via the membrane-bound IL6R is mostly regenerative and anti-inflammatory (Probable).

Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes (PubMed:21152046, PubMed:28167758, PubMed:37478846). The RXR/RAR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5 (PubMed:19398580, PubMed:28167758). In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression (PubMed:16417524). On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and associate with the coactivators leading to transcriptional activation (PubMed:19850744, PubMed:20215566, PubMed:37478846, PubMed:9267036). Formation of a complex with histone deacetylases might lead to inhibition of RARE DNA element binding and to transcriptional repression (PubMed:28167758). Transcriptional activation and RARE DNA element binding might be supported by the transcription factor KLF2 (PubMed:28167758). RARA plays an essential role in the regulation of retinoic acid-induced germ cell development during spermatogenesis (By similarity). Has a role in the survival of early spermatocytes at the beginning prophase of meiosis (By similarity). In Sertoli cells, may promote the survival and development of early meiotic prophase spermatocytes (By similarity).

Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN) (Probable). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN) (PubMed:21411625). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1 (Probable). Phosphorylates PKP3 at 'Tyr-195' in response to reactive oxygen species, which may cause the release of PKP3 from desmosome cell junctions into the cytoplasm (PubMed:25501895). Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors (By similarity). Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1 (PubMed:11389730). Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation (PubMed:18586953). Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of GRK2, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor (Probable). Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus (PubMed:7853507). Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function.

Plays a role as coinhibitory receptor in immune response, insulin action and functions also as an activator during angiogenesis (PubMed:18424730, PubMed:23696226, PubMed:25363763). Its coinhibitory receptor function is phosphorylation- and PTPN6 -dependent, which in turn, suppress signal transduction of associated receptors by dephosphorylation of their downstream effectors. Plays a role in immune response, of T cells, natural killer (NK) and neutrophils (PubMed:18424730, PubMed:23696226). Upon TCR/CD3 complex stimulation, inhibits TCR-mediated cytotoxicity by blocking granule exocytosis by mediating homophilic binding to adjacent cells, allowing interaction with and phosphorylation by LCK and interaction with the TCR/CD3 complex which recruits PTPN6 resulting in dephosphorylation of CD247 and ZAP70 (PubMed:18424730).

Upon neutrophils activation negatively regulates IL1B production by recruiting PTPN6 to a SYK-TLR4-CEACAM1 complex, that dephosphorylates SYK, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosome disruption, which in turn, reduces the activity of the inflammasome. Down-regulates neutrophil production by acting as a coinhibitory receptor for CSF3R by down-regulating the CSF3R-STAT3 pathway through recruitment of PTPN6 that dephosphorylates CSF3R (By similarity). Also regulates insulin action by promoting INS clearance and regulating lipogenesis in liver through regulating insulin signaling (By similarity). Upon INS stimulation, undergoes phosphorylation by INSR leading to INS clearance by increasing receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis. This inernalization promotes interaction with FASN leading to receptor-mediated insulin degradation and to reduction of FASN activity leading to negative regulation of fatty acid synthesis. INSR-mediated phosphorylation also provokes a down-regulation of cell proliferation through SHC1 interaction resulting in decrease coupling of SHC1 to the MAPK3/ERK1-MAPK1/ERK2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (By similarity). Functions as activator in angiogenesis by promoting blood vessel remodeling through endothelial cell differentiation and migration and in arteriogenesis by increasing the number of collateral arteries and collateral vessel calibers after ischemia.

Binds two different NK cell receptors: CD96 and CD226. These interactions accumulates at the cell-cell contact site, leading to the formation of a mature immunological synapse between NK cell and target cell. This may trigger adhesion and secretion of lytic granules and IFN-gamma and activate cytotoxicity of activated NK cells. May also promote NK cell-target cell modular exchange, and PVR transfer to the NK cell. This transfer is more important in some tumor cells expressing a lot of PVR, and may trigger fratricide NK cell activation, providing tumors with a mechanism of immunoevasion. Plays a role in mediating tumor cell invasion and migration. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15471548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15607800}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for poliovirus.

P16389	KCNA2_HUMAN	Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 2 (NGK1) (Voltage-gated K(+) channel HuKIV) (Voltage-gated potassium channel HBK5) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	499	delayed rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0005251]; kinesin binding [GO:0019894]; outward rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0015271]; potassium channel activity [GO:0005267]; voltage-gated monoatomic ion channel activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential [GO:1905030]; voltage-gated monoatomic ion channel activity involved in regulation of presynaptic membrane potential [GO:0099508]; voltage-gated potassium channel activity [GO:0005249]	FUNCTION: Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in the brain and the central nervous system, but also in the cardiovascular system. Prevents aberrant action potential firing and regulates neuronal output. Forms tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (PubMed:11211111, PubMed:19912772, PubMed:23769686, PubMed:8495559). Can form functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5, KCNA6, KCNA7, and possibly other family members as well; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel (PubMed:20220134, PubMed:8495559). Channel properties are modulated by cytoplasmic beta subunits that regulate the subcellular location of the alpha subunits and promote rapid inactivation of delayed rectifier potassium channels. In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign currents observed in intact tissues to any particular potassium channel family member. Homotetrameric KCNA2 forms a delayed-rectifier potassium channel that opens in response to membrane depolarization, followed by slow spontaneous channel closure (PubMed:19912772, PubMed:23769686). In contrast, a heteromultimer formed by KCNA2 and KCNA4 shows rapid inactivation (PubMed:8495559). Regulates neuronal excitability and plays a role as pacemaker in the regulation of neuronal action potentials (By similarity). KCNA2-containing channels play a presynaptic role and prevent hyperexcitability and aberrant action potential firing (By similarity). Response to toxins that are selective for KCNA2-containing potassium channels suggests that in Purkinje cells, dendritic subthreshold KCNA2-containing potassium channels prevent random spontaneous calcium spikes, suppressing dendritic hyperexcitability without hindering the generation of somatic action potentials, and thereby play an important role in motor coordination (By similarity). Plays a role in the induction of long-term potentiation of neuron excitability in the CA3 layer of the hippocampus (By similarity). May function as down-stream effector for G protein-coupled receptors and inhibit GABAergic inputs to basolateral amygdala neurons (By similarity). May contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (By similarity). Contributes to the regulation of the axonal release of the neurotransmitter dopamine (By similarity). Reduced KCNA2 expression plays a role in the perception of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury, but not acute pain (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of the time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63141, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P63142, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11211111, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19912772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20220134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23769686, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32833227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35439054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37883018, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8495559, ECO:0000305}.

Ligands can be of proteinaceous nature like thrombospondin, fibronectin, collagen or amyloid-beta as well as of lipidic nature such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), anionic phospholipids, long-chain fatty acids and bacterial diacylated lipopeptides. They are generally multivalent and can therefore engage multiple receptors simultaneously, the resulting formation of CD36 clusters initiates signal transduction and internalization of receptor-ligand complexes. The dependency on coreceptor signaling is strongly ligand specific. Cellular responses to these ligands are involved in angiogenesis, inflammatory response, fatty acid metabolism, taste and dietary fat processing in the intestine (Probable). Binds long-chain fatty acids and facilitates their transport into cells, thus participating in muscle lipid utilization, adipose energy storage, and gut fat absorption (By similarity) (PubMed:18353783, PubMed:21610069). Mechanistically, binding of fatty acids activates downstream kinase LYN, which phosphorylates the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5 and inactivates it, resulting in the subsequent depalmitoylation of CD36 and caveolar endocytosis (PubMed:32958780). In the small intestine, plays a role in proximal absorption of dietary fatty acid and cholesterol for optimal chylomicron formation, possibly through the activation of MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway (By similarity) (PubMed:18753675). Involved in oral fat perception and preferences (PubMed:22240721, PubMed:25822988). Detection into the tongue of long-chain fatty acids leads to a rapid and sustained rise in flux and protein content of pancreatobiliary secretions (By similarity). In taste receptor cells, mediates the induction of an increase in intracellular calcium levels by long-chain fatty acids, leading to the activation of the gustatory neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (By similarity). Important factor in both ventromedial hypothalamus neuronal sensing of long-chain fatty acid and the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis (By similarity). Receptor for thrombospondins, THBS1 and THBS2, mediating their antiangiogenic effects (By similarity). Involved in inducing apoptosis in podocytes in response to elevated free fatty acids, acting together with THBS1 (By similarity). As a coreceptor for TLR4:TLR6 heterodimer, promotes inflammation in monocytes/macrophages. Upon ligand binding, such as oxLDL or amyloid-beta 42, interacts with the heterodimer TLR4:TLR6, the complex is internalized and triggers inflammatory response, leading to NF-kappa-B-dependent production of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL9 cytokines, via MYD88 signaling pathway, and CCL5 cytokine, via TICAM1 signaling pathway, as well as IL1B secretion, through the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (By similarity) (PubMed:20037584). Selective and nonredundant sensor of microbial diacylated lipopeptide that signal via TLR2:TLR6 heterodimer, this cluster triggers signaling from the cell surface, leading to the NF-kappa-B-dependent production of TNF, via MYD88 signaling pathway and subsequently is targeted to the Golgi in a lipid-raft dependent pathway (By similarity) (PubMed:16880211). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q07969, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q08857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16880211, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18353783, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20037584, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21395585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21610069, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22240721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25822988, ECO:0000305|PubMed:19471024}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Directly mediates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and the internalization of particles independently of TLR signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10890433, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12506336, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19864601}.

Type I interferon binding activates the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, resulting in transcriptional activation or repression of interferon-regulated genes that encode the effectors of the interferon response (PubMed:10049744, PubMed:21854986, PubMed:7665574). Mechanistically, type I interferon-binding brings the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits into close proximity with one another, driving their associated Janus kinases (JAKs) (TYK2 bound to IFNAR1 and JAK1 bound to IFNAR2) to cross-phosphorylate one another (PubMed:21854986, PubMed:32972995, PubMed:7665574, PubMed:7813427).

Inhibits viral replication via the integrated stress response (ISR): EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to viral infection converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, resulting to a shutdown of cellular and viral protein synthesis, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4 (PubMed:19189853, PubMed:21123651, PubMed:22948139, PubMed:23229543). Exerts its antiviral activity on a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus (MV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1) (PubMed:11836380, PubMed:19189853, PubMed:19840259, PubMed:20171114, PubMed:21710204, PubMed:23115276, PubMed:23399035). Also involved in the regulation of signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation: phosphorylates other substrates including p53/TP53, PPP2R5A, DHX9, ILF3, IRS1 and the HHV-1 viral protein US11 (PubMed:11836380, PubMed:19229320, PubMed:22214662). In addition to serine/threonine-protein kinase activity, also has tyrosine-protein kinase activity and phosphorylates CDK1 at 'Tyr-4' upon DNA damage, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20395957). Either as an adapter protein and/or via its kinase activity, can regulate various signaling pathways (p38 MAP kinase, NF-kappa-B and insulin signaling pathways) and transcription factors (JUN, STAT1, STAT3, IRF1, ATF3) involved in the expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs (PubMed:22948139, PubMed:23084476, PubMed:23372823). Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via interaction with IKBKB and TRAF family of proteins and activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway via interaction with MAP2K6 (PubMed:10848580, PubMed:15121867, PubMed:15229216). Can act as both a positive and negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway (ISP) (PubMed:20685959). Negatively regulates ISP by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at 'Ser-312' and positively regulates ISP via phosphorylation of PPP2R5A which activates FOXO1, which in turn up-regulates the expression of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) (PubMed:20685959). Can regulate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes (PubMed:22801494). Plays a role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton by binding to gelsolin (GSN), sequestering the protein in an inactive conformation away from actin (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10848580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11836380, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15121867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15229216, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18835251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19189853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19229320, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19507191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19840259, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20171114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20685959, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21072047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21123651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21710204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22214662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22381929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22801494, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22948139, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23084476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23115276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23372823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23399035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32197074}.

Specifically recognizes and binds E-box sequences (5'-CANNTG-3'); efficient DNA-binding requires dimerization with itself or with another MiT/TFE family member such as TFEB or MITF (PubMed:24448649). Involved in the cellular response to amino acid availability by acting downstream of MTOR: in the presence of nutrients, TFE3 phosphorylation by MTOR promotes its inactivation (PubMed:24448649, PubMed:31672913, PubMed:36608670). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of MTOR induces TFE3 dephosphorylation, resulting in transcription factor activity (PubMed:24448649, PubMed:31672913, PubMed:36608670). Specifically recognizes and binds the CLEAR-box sequence (5'-GTCACGTGAC-3') present in the regulatory region of many lysosomal genes, leading to activate their expression, thereby playing a central role in expression of lysosomal genes (PubMed:24448649). Maintains the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells by promoting the expression of genes such as ESRRB; mTOR-dependent TFE3 cytosolic retention and inactivation promotes exit from pluripotency (By similarity). Required to maintain the naive pluripotent state of hematopoietic stem cell; mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic retention of TFE3 promotes the exit of hematopoietic stem cell from pluripotency (PubMed:30733432). TFE3 activity is also involved in the inhibition of neuronal progenitor differentiation (By similarity). Acts as a positive regulator of browning of adipose tissue by promoting expression of target genes; mTOR-dependent phosphorylation promotes cytoplasmic retention of TFE3 and inhibits browning of adipose tissue (By similarity).

P19793	RXRA_HUMAN	Retinoic acid receptor RXR-alpha (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group B member 1) (Retinoid X receptor alpha)	Homo sapiens (Human)	462	DNA binding domain binding [GO:0050692]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity [GO:0003700]; DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific [GO:0000981]; double-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003690]; enzyme binding [GO:0019899]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; LBD domain binding [GO:0050693]; nuclear receptor activity [GO:0004879]; nuclear steroid receptor activity [GO:0003707]; nuclear vitamin D receptor binding [GO:0042809]; peptide binding [GO:0042277]; retinoic acid binding [GO:0001972]; retinoic acid-responsive element binding [GO:0044323]; RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000978]; RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0000977]; sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0043565]; sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding [GO:1990837]; transcription cis-regulatory region binding [GO:0000976]; transcription coregulator binding [GO:0001221]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]	FUNCTION: Receptor for retinoic acid that acts as a transcription factor (PubMed:10874028, PubMed:11162439, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:37478846). Forms homo- or heterodimers with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and binds to target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, to regulate gene expression in various biological processes (PubMed:10195690, PubMed:11162439, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:16107141, PubMed:17761950, PubMed:18800767, PubMed:19167885, PubMed:28167758, PubMed:37478846). The RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5 to regulate transcription (PubMed:10195690, PubMed:11162439, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:17761950, PubMed:28167758). The high affinity ligand for retinoid X receptors (RXRs) is 9-cis retinoic acid (PubMed:1310260). In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression (PubMed:20215566). On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and coactivators are recruited leading to transcriptional activation (PubMed:20215566, PubMed:37478846, PubMed:9267036). Serves as a common heterodimeric partner for a number of nuclear receptors, such as RARA, RARB and PPARA (PubMed:10195690, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:28167758, PubMed:29021580). The RXRA/RARB heterodimer can act as a transcriptional repressor or transcriptional activator, depending on the RARE DNA element context (PubMed:29021580). The RXRA/PPARA heterodimer is required for PPARA transcriptional activity on fatty acid oxidation genes such as ACOX1 and the P450 system genes (PubMed:10195690). Together with RARA, positively regulates microRNA-10a expression, thereby inhibiting the GATA6/VCAM1 signaling response to pulsatile shear stress in vascular endothelial cells (PubMed:28167758). Acts as an enhancer of RARA binding to RARE DNA element (PubMed:28167758). May facilitate the nuclear import of heterodimerization partners such as VDR and NR4A1 (PubMed:12145331, PubMed:15509776). Promotes myelin debris phagocytosis and remyelination by macrophages (PubMed:26463675). Plays a role in the attenuation of the innate immune system in response to viral infections, possibly by negatively regulating the transcription of antiviral genes such as type I IFN genes (PubMed:25417649).

P21554	CNR1_HUMAN	Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB-R) (CB1) (CANN6)	Homo sapiens (Human)	472	cannabinoid receptor activity [GO:0004949]; G protein-coupled receptor activity [GO:0004930]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]	FUNCTION: G-protein coupled receptor for endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs), including N-arachidonoylethanolamide (also called anandamide or AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), as well as phytocannabinoids, such as delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (PubMed:15620723, PubMed:27768894, PubMed:27851727). Mediates many cannabinoid-induced effects, acting, among others, on food intake, memory loss, gastrointestinal motility, catalepsy, ambulatory activity, anxiety, chronic pain. Signaling typically involves reduction in cyclic AMP (PubMed:1718258, PubMed:21895628, PubMed:27768894). In the hypothalamus, may have a dual effect on mitochondrial respiration depending upon the agonist dose and possibly upon the cell type. Increases respiration at low doses, while decreases respiration at high doses. At high doses, CNR1 signal transduction involves G-protein alpha-i protein activation and subsequent inhibition of mitochondrial soluble adenylate cyclase, decrease in cyclic AMP concentration, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of specific subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport system, including NDUFS2. In the hypothalamus, inhibits leptin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and mediates cannabinoid-induced increase in SREBF1 and FASN gene expression. In response to cannabinoids, drives the release of orexigenic beta-endorphin, but not that of melanocyte-stimulating hormone alpha/alpha-MSH, from hypothalamic POMC neurons, hence promoting food intake. In the hippocampus, regulates cellular respiration and energy production in response to cannabinoids. Involved in cannabinoid-dependent depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a process in which depolarization of CA1 postsynaptic pyramidal neurons mobilizes eCBs, which retrogradely activate presynaptic CB1 receptors, transiently decreasing GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. Also reduces excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). In superior cervical ganglions and cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibits voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in a constitutive, as well as agonist-dependent manner (PubMed:17895407). In cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, cannabinoid-induced inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular tone (By similarity). Induces leptin production in adipocytes and reduces LRP2-mediated leptin clearance in the kidney, hence participating in hyperleptinemia. In adipose tissue, CNR1 signaling leads to increased expression of SREBF1, ACACA and FASN genes (By similarity). In the liver, activation by endocannabinoids leads to increased de novo lipogenesis and reduced fatty acid catabolism, associated with increased expression of SREBF1/SREBP-1, GCK, ACACA, ACACB and FASN genes. May also affect de novo cholesterol synthesis and HDL-cholesteryl ether uptake. Peripherally modulates energy metabolism (By similarity). In high carbohydrate diet-induced obesity, may decrease the expression of mitochondrial dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase/DLD in striated muscles, as well as that of selected glucose/ pyruvate metabolic enzymes, hence affecting energy expenditure through mitochondrial metabolism (By similarity). In response to cannabinoid anandamide, elicits a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages, which involves NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL1B and IL18 secretion (By similarity). In macrophages infiltrating pancreatic islets, this process may participate in the progression of type-2 diabetes and associated loss of pancreatic beta-cells (PubMed:23955712). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O02777, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1718258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17895407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21895628, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23955712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27768894, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27851727}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Binds both 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620723}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Only binds 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) with high affinity.

The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:7947975). Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection.

Regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation of EIF4B, RPS6 and EEF2K, and contributes to cell survival by repressing the pro-apoptotic function of BAD (PubMed:11500364, PubMed:12801526, PubMed:14673156, PubMed:15071500, PubMed:15341740, PubMed:16286006, PubMed:17052453, PubMed:17053147, PubMed:17936702, PubMed:18952604, PubMed:19085255, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:28178239). Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147). Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR (PubMed:15341740). In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2 (PubMed:11500364). Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling (PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915). Also involved in feedback regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by phosphorylating DEPTOR (PubMed:22017876). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and suppressing its pro-apoptotic function (By similarity). Phosphorylates mitochondrial URI1 leading to dissociation of a URI1-PPP1CC complex (PubMed:17936702). The free mitochondrial PPP1CC can then dephosphorylate RPS6KB1 at Thr-412, which is proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism for the RPS6KB1 anti-apoptotic function (PubMed:17936702). Mediates TNF-alpha-induced insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues, resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS1 (PubMed:18952604). In cells lacking functional TSC1-2 complex, constitutively phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3B (PubMed:17052453). May be involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement through binding to neurabin (By similarity). Phosphorylates and activates the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme CAD, downstream of MTOR (PubMed:23429703).

F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Subunits alpha and beta form the catalytic core in F(1). Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits. Subunit alpha does not bear the catalytic high-affinity ATP-binding sites (By similarity). Binds the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and can promote mitochondrial accumulation of enterobactin-derived iron ions (PubMed:30146159). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P19483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30146159}.

Chloride influx into the postsynaptic neuron following GABAAR opening decreases the neuron ability to generate a new action potential, thereby reducing nerve transmission (PubMed:22303015, PubMed:26950270). GABAARs containing alpha-1 and beta-3 subunits exhibit synaptogenic activity; the gamma-2 subunit being necessary but not sufficient to induce rapid synaptic contacts formation (PubMed:25489750). Extrasynaptic beta-3 receptors contribute to the tonic GABAergic inhibition (By similarity). GABAARs containing alpha-1, beta-3 and epsilon subunits may also permit spontaneous chloride channel activity while preserving the structural information required for GABA-gated openings (By similarity). Beta-containing GABAARs can simultaneously bind GABA and histamine where histamine binds at the interface of two neighboring beta subunits, which may be involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness (PubMed:18281286, PubMed:24909990, PubMed:35355020).

TMA is generated by the action of gut microbiota using dietary precursors such as choline, choline containing compounds, betaine or L-carnitine.

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31750, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10926925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12172553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12176338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12964941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15861136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16139227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18507042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20086174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20682768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30504268, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31204173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31548394, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32228865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33594058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829964, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11882383, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21432781, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21620960}.

The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. The cytochrome b-c1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this redox reaction to translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, with protons being carried across the membrane as hydrogens on the quinol.

During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Mediates endocytosis of CCR7 following ligation of CCL19 but not CCL21. Involved in internalization of P2RY1, P2RY4, P2RY6 and P2RY11 and ATP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 and subsequent recycling or degradation. Involved in ubiquitination of IGF1R. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK10 (JNK3). ERK1/2 and JNK3 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold are largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Increases ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Involved in CCR7-mediated ERK1/2 signaling involving ligand CCL19. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated ERK activity. Is involved in type-1A angiotensin II receptor/AGTR1-mediated MAPK10 activity. Is involved in dopamine-stimulated AKT1 activity in the striatum by disrupting the association of AKT1 with its negative regulator PP2A. Involved in AGTR1-mediated chemotaxis. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. Suppresses UV-induced NF-kappa-B-dependent activation by interacting with CHUK. The function is promoted by stimulation of ADRB2 and dephosphorylation of ARRB2. Involved in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulating MDM2 and reducing the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53/TP53. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Upon stimulation of OR1D2, may be involved in regulation of gene expression during the early processes of fertilization. Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in endocytosis of TGFBR2 and TGFBR3 and down-regulates TGF-beta signaling such as NF-kappa-B activation. Involved in endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein receptor/LDLR. Involved in endocytosis of smoothened homolog/Smo, which also requires GRK2. Involved in endocytosis of SLC9A5. Involved in endocytosis of ENG and subsequent TGF-beta-mediated ERK activation and migration of epithelial cells.

Part of the L-cysteine derived from the trans-sulfuration pathway is utilized for biosynthesis of the ubiquitous antioxidant glutathione (PubMed:18476726). Besides its role in the conversion of L-cystathionine into L-cysteine, it utilizes L-cysteine and L-homocysteine as substrates (at much lower rates than L,L-cystathionine) to produce the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (PubMed:10212249, PubMed:19019829, PubMed:19261609, PubMed:19961860). In vitro, it converts two L-cysteine molecules into lanthionine and H2S, also two L-homocysteine molecules to homolanthionine and H2S, which can be particularly relevant under conditions of severe hyperhomocysteinemia (which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease) (PubMed:19261609). Lanthionine and homolanthionine are structural homologs of L,L-cystathionine that differ by the absence or presence of an extra methylene group, respectively (PubMed:19261609). Acts as a cysteine-protein sulfhydrase by mediating sulfhydration of target proteins: sulfhydration consists of converting -SH groups into -SSH on specific cysteine residues of target proteins such as GAPDH, PTPN1 and NF-kappa-B subunit RELA, thereby regulating their function (PubMed:22169477). By generating the gasotransmitter H2S, it participates in a number of physiological processes such as vasodilation, bone protection, and inflammation (Probable) (PubMed:29254196). Plays an essential role in myogenesis by contributing to the biogenesis of H2S in skeletal muscle tissue (By similarity). Can also accept homoserine as substrate (By similarity). Catalyzes the elimination of selenocystathionine (which can be derived from the diet) to yield selenocysteine, ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P18757, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8VCN5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10212249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19019829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19261609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19961860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22169477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29254196, ECO:0000303|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:18476726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:19019829}.

Transduces the activin signal from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and is thus regulating a many physiological and pathological processes including neuronal differentiation and neuronal survival, hair follicle development and cycling, FSH production by the pituitary gland, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, immunosuppression and carcinogenesis. Activin is also thought to have a paracrine or autocrine role in follicular development in the ovary. Within the receptor complex, type-2 receptors (ACVR2A and/or ACVR2B) act as a primary activin receptors whereas the type-1 receptors like ACVR1B act as downstream transducers of activin signals. Activin binds to type-2 receptor at the plasma membrane and activates its serine-threonine kinase. The activated receptor type-2 then phosphorylates and activates the type-1 receptor such as ACVR1B. Once activated, the type-1 receptor binds and phosphorylates the SMAD proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3, on serine residues of the C-terminal tail. Soon after their association with the activin receptor and subsequent phosphorylation, SMAD2 and SMAD3 are released into the cytoplasm where they interact with the common partner SMAD4. This SMAD complex translocates into the nucleus where it mediates activin-induced transcription. Inhibitory SMAD7, which is recruited to ACVR1B through FKBP1A, can prevent the association of SMAD2 and SMAD3 with the activin receptor complex, thereby blocking the activin signal. Activin signal transduction is also antagonized by the binding to the receptor of inhibin-B via the IGSF1 inhibin coreceptor. ACVR1B also phosphorylates TDP2. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12364468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12639945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18039968, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20226172, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8196624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9032295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9892009}.

The formation of the receptor complex composed of 2 TGFBR1 and 2 TGFBR2 molecules symmetrically bound to the cytokine dimer results in the phosphorylation and the activation of TGFBR1 by the constitutively active TGFBR2. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 which dissociates from the receptor and interacts with SMAD4.

This constitutes the canonical SMAD-dependent TGF-beta signaling cascade. Also involved in non-canonical, SMAD-independent TGF-beta signaling pathways.

The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Its RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA-helicase activities are induced by CASC3, but abolished in presence of the MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The inhibition of ATPase activity by the MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer increases the RNA-binding affinity of the EJC.

Is necessary for BCR-ABL oncogene-mediated resistance to apoptotic drug in leukemia cells, protecting leukemia cells against drug-induced apoptosis. In cultured neurons, prevents amyloid beta protein-induced apoptosis by interrupting cell death process at a very early step. In glioblastoma cells, may function downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) and PDPK1 in the promotion of cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic factor BAD. Can form a protein complex in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with PARD6A and ECT2 and regulate ECT2 oncogenic activity by phosphorylation, which in turn promotes transformed growth and invasion. In response to nerve growth factor (NGF), acts downstream of SRC to phosphorylate and activate IRAK1, allowing the subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B and neuronal cell survival. Functions in the organization of the apical domain in epithelial cells by phosphorylating EZR. This step is crucial for activation and normal distribution of EZR at the early stages of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.

Crotonylation marks active promoters and enhancers and confers resistance to transcriptional repressors (PubMed:25417107, PubMed:27105114, PubMed:27545619). Recognizes and binds histone H3 crotonylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9cr), and with slightly lower affinity histone H3 crotonylated at 'Lys-18' (H3K18cr) (PubMed:27105114).

In the SEC complex, MLLT3 is required to recruit the complex to crotonylated histones (PubMed:27105114, PubMed:27545619). Recruitment of the SEC complex to crotonylated histones promotes recruitment of DOT1L on active chromatin to deposit histone H3 'Lys-79' methylation (H3K79me) (PubMed:25417107). Plays a key role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance by preserving, rather than conferring, HSC stemness (PubMed:31776511).

Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Tyr-420. Phosphorylation leads to TXK full activation. Contributes also to signaling from many receptors and participates in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Like ITK, can phosphorylate PLCG1, leading to its localization in lipid rafts and activation, followed by subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Plays a role in the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 cells as part of an IFNG promoter-binding complex with PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:11859127, PubMed:17177976). Within the complex, phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:17177976). Phosphorylates also key sites in LCP2 leading to the up-regulation of Th1 preferred cytokine IL-2. Phosphorylates 'Tyr-201' of CTLA4 which leads to the association of PI-3 kinase with the CTLA4 receptor. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10523612, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11564877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11859127, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17177976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9813138}.

Phosphorylates STMN2 and hence regulates microtubule dynamics, controlling neurite elongation in cortical neurons (By similarity). In the developing brain, through its cytoplasmic activity on STMN2, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and of radial migration from the ventricular zone (By similarity). Phosphorylates several other substrates including heat shock factor protein 4 (HSF4), the deacetylase SIRT1, ELK1, or the E3 ligase ITCH (PubMed:16581800, PubMed:17296730, PubMed:20027304). Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates the heat shock transcription factor HSF1, suppressing HSF1-induced transcriptional activity (PubMed:10747973). Phosphorylates POU5F1, which results in the inhibition of POU5F1's transcriptional activity and enhances its proteasomal degradation (By similarity).

The Hippo signaling pathway core involves a kinase cascade featuring STK3/MST2 and STK4/MST1, along with its regulatory partner SAV1, which phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with their regulatory protein, MOB1. This activation leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ (PubMed:18158288). Phosphorylation of YAP1 by LATS1/2 prevents its nuclear translocation, thereby regulating the expression of its target genes (PubMed:18158288, PubMed:26598551, PubMed:34404733). The transcriptional regulation of gene expression requires TEAD transcription factors and modulates cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PubMed:18579750). Plays a key role in tissue tension and 3D tissue shape by regulating the cortical actomyosin network, acting via ARHGAP18, a Rho GTPase activating protein that suppresses F-actin polymerization (PubMed:25778702). It also suppresses ciliogenesis by acting as a transcriptional corepressor of TEAD4 target genes AURKA and PLK1 (PubMed:25849865).

Specifically binds the 5'-ACAAAG-3' DNA motif present in enhancers and super-enhancers and promotes expression of genes important for chondrogenesis, including cartilage matrix protein-coding genes COL2A1, COL4A2, COL9A1, COL11A2 and ACAN, SOX5 and SOX6 (PubMed:8640233). Also binds to some promoter regions (By similarity). Plays a central role in successive steps of chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity). Absolutely required for precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes (By similarity). Together with SOX5 and SOX6, required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes, the second step in chondrogenesis (By similarity). Later, required to direct hypertrophic maturation and block osteoblast differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes: maintains chondrocyte columnar proliferation, delays prehypertrophy and then prevents osteoblastic differentiation of chondrocytes by lowering beta-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling and RUNX2 expression (By similarity). Also required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, both indirectly, by keeping the lineage fate of chondrocytes, and directly, by remaining present in upper hypertrophic cells and transactivating COL10A1 along with MEF2C (By similarity).

P49005	DPOD2_HUMAN	DNA polymerase delta subunit 2 (DNA polymerase delta subunit p50)	Homo sapiens (Human)	469	DNA binding [GO:0003677]	FUNCTION: Accessory component of both the DNA polymerase delta complex and the DNA polymerase zeta complex (PubMed:17317665, PubMed:22801543, PubMed:24449906). As a component of the trimeric and tetrameric DNA polymerase delta complexes (Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4, respectively), plays a role in high fidelity genome replication, including in lagging strand synthesis, and repair (PubMed:12403614, PubMed:16510448, PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433, PubMed:24035200). Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 are characterized by the absence or the presence of POLD4. They exhibit differences in catalytic activity. Most notably, Pol-delta3 shows higher proofreading activity than Pol-delta4 (PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433). Although both Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 process Okazaki fragments in vitro, Pol-delta3 may also be better suited to fulfill this task, exhibiting near-absence of strand displacement activity compared to Pol-delta4 and stalling on encounter with the 5'-blocking oligonucleotides. Pol-delta3 idling process may avoid the formation of a gap, while maintaining a nick that can be readily ligated (PubMed:24035200). Along with DNA polymerase kappa, DNA polymerase delta carries out approximately half of nucleotide excision repair (NER) synthesis following UV irradiation (PubMed:20227374). Under conditions of DNA replication stress, required for the repair of broken replication forks through break-induced replication (BIR) (PubMed:24310611). Involved in the translesion synthesis (TLS) of templates carrying O6-methylguanine or abasic sites performed by Pol-delta4, independently of DNA polymerase zeta (REV3L) or eta (POLH). Facilitates abasic site bypass by DNA polymerase delta by promoting extension from the nucleotide inserted opposite the lesion. Also involved in TLS as a component of the DNA polymerase zeta complex (PubMed:24449906). Along with POLD3, dramatically increases the efficiency and processivity of DNA synthesis of the DNA polymerase zeta complex compared to the minimal zeta complex, consisting of only REV3L and REV7 (PubMed:24449906). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12403614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16510448, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19074196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20227374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20334433, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24035200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24310611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24449906}.

P49407	ARRB1_HUMAN	Beta-arrestin-1 (Arrestin beta-1) (Non-visual arrestin-2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	418	angiotensin receptor binding [GO:0031701]; arrestin family protein binding [GO:1990763]; enzyme inhibitor activity [GO:0004857]; G protein-coupled receptor binding [GO:0001664]; GTPase activator activity [GO:0005096]; insulin-like growth factor receptor binding [GO:0005159]; transcription coactivator activity [GO:0003713]; ubiquitin protein ligase binding [GO:0031625]	FUNCTION: Functions in regulating agonist-mediated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes. During homologous desensitization, beta-arrestins bind to the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and sterically preclude its coupling to the cognate G-protein; the binding appears to require additional receptor determinants exposed only in the active receptor conformation. The beta-arrestins target many receptors for internalization by acting as endocytic adapters (CLASPs, clathrin-associated sorting proteins) and recruiting the GPRCs to the adapter protein 2 complex 2 (AP-2) in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, the extent of beta-arrestin involvement appears to vary significantly depending on the receptor, agonist and cell type. Internalized arrestin-receptor complexes traffic to intracellular endosomes, where they remain uncoupled from G-proteins. Two different modes of arrestin-mediated internalization occur. Class A receptors, like ADRB2, OPRM1, ENDRA, D1AR and ADRA1B dissociate from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergo rapid recycling. Class B receptors, like AVPR2, AGTR1, NTSR1, TRHR and TACR1 internalize as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptors, for extended periods of time. Receptor resensitization then requires that receptor-bound arrestin is removed so that the receptor can be dephosphorylated and returned to the plasma membrane. Involved in internalization of P2RY4 and UTP-stimulated internalization of P2RY2. Involved in phosphorylation-dependent internalization of OPRD1 ands subsequent recycling. Involved in the degradation of cAMP by recruiting cAMP phosphodiesterases to ligand-activated receptors. Beta-arrestins function as multivalent adapter proteins that can switch the GPCR from a G-protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a beta-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Acts as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways such as MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 activated by the beta-arrestin scaffold is largely excluded from the nucleus and confined to cytoplasmic locations such as endocytic vesicles, also called beta-arrestin signalosomes. Recruits c-Src/SRC to ADRB2 resulting in ERK activation. GPCRs for which the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on both ARRB1 and ARRB2 (codependent regulation) include ADRB2, F2RL1 and PTH1R. For some GPCRs the beta-arrestin-mediated signaling relies on either ARRB1 or ARRB2 and is inhibited by the other respective beta-arrestin form (reciprocal regulation). Inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in AGTR1- and AVPR2-mediated activation (reciprocal regulation). Is required for SP-stimulated endocytosis of NK1R and recruits c-Src/SRC to internalized NK1R resulting in ERK1/2 activation, which is required for the antiapoptotic effects of SP. Is involved in proteinase-activated F2RL1-mediated ERK activity. Acts as a signaling scaffold for the AKT1 pathway. Is involved in alpha-thrombin-stimulated AKT1 signaling. Is involved in IGF1-stimulated AKT1 signaling leading to increased protection from apoptosis. Involved in activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and in actin bundle formation. Involved in F2RL1-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement and chemotaxis. Involved in AGTR1-mediated stress fiber formation by acting together with GNAQ to activate RHOA. Appears to function as signaling scaffold involved in regulation of MIP-1-beta-stimulated CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. Involved in attenuation of NF-kappa-B-dependent transcription in response to GPCR or cytokine stimulation by interacting with and stabilizing CHUK. May serve as nuclear messenger for GPCRs. Involved in OPRD1-stimulated transcriptional regulation by translocating to CDKN1B and FOS promoter regions and recruiting EP300 resulting in acetylation of histone H4. Involved in regulation of LEF1 transcriptional activity via interaction with DVL1 and/or DVL2 Also involved in regulation of receptors other than GPCRs. Involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling through the interaction with TRAF6 which prevents TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization required for activation of NF-kappa-B and JUN. Binds phosphoinositides. Binds inositolhexakisphosphate (InsP6) (By similarity). Involved in IL8-mediated granule release in neutrophils. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced RAC1-LIMK1-PAK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin (CFL1) and for the up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation. Involved in the internalization of the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3. Negatively regulates the NOTCH signaling pathway by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH1 by ITCH.

Plays an important role in the differential regulation of pro-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1, PIK3R4 and UVRAG or ATG14) and non-autophagy (composed of PIK3C3, BECN1 and PIK3R4) complexes, in response to glucose starvation (By similarity). Can inhibit the non-autophagy complex by phosphorylating PIK3C3 and can activate the pro-autophagy complex by phosphorylating BECN1 (By similarity). Upon glucose starvation, promotes ARF6 activation in a kinase-independent manner leading to cell migration (PubMed:36017701). Upon glucose deprivation mediates the phosphorylation of ACSS2 at 'Ser-659', which exposes the nuclear localization signal of ACSS2, required for its interaction with KPNA1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:28552616). Upon stress, regulates mitochondrial fragmentation through phosphorylation of MTFR1L (PubMed:36367943). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q09137, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8BRK8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11518699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11554766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12519745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14651849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15866171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17486097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17711846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18184930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20074060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20160076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21205641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25687571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28552616, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28561066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32029622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34077757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36017701, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36367943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:36732624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37079666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7959015, ECO:0000303|PubMed:17307971, ECO:0000303|PubMed:17712357}.

Binds to polyubiquitin chains. Proposed to be capable to bind simultaneously to the 26S proteasome and to polyubiquitinated substrates and to deliver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. May play a role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded glycoproteins by association with PNGase and delivering deglycosylated proteins to the proteasome.; FUNCTION: Involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) by acting as component of the XPC complex. Cooperatively with CETN2 appears to stabilize XPC. May protect XPC from proteasomal degradation.; FUNCTION: The XPC complex is proposed to represent the first factor bound at the sites of DNA damage and together with other core recognition factors, XPA, RPA and the TFIIH complex, is part of the pre-incision (or initial recognition) complex. The XPC complex recognizes a wide spectrum of damaged DNA characterized by distortions of the DNA helix such as single-stranded loops, mismatched bubbles or single-stranded overhangs. The orientation of XPC complex binding appears to be crucial for inducing a productive NER. XPC complex is proposed to recognize and to interact with unpaired bases on the undamaged DNA strand which is followed by recruitment of the TFIIH complex and subsequent scanning for lesions in the opposite strand in a 5'-to-3' direction by the NER machinery. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) which are formed upon UV-induced DNA damage esacpe detection by the XPC complex due to a low degree of structural perurbation. Instead they are detected by the UV-DDB complex which in turn recruits and cooperates with the XPC complex in the respective DNA repair. In vitro, the XPC:RAD23B dimer is sufficient to initiate NER; it preferentially binds to cisplatin and UV-damaged double-stranded DNA and also binds to a variety of chemically and structurally diverse DNA adducts. XPC:RAD23B contacts DNA both 5' and 3' of a cisplatin lesion with a preference for the 5' side. XPC:RAD23B induces a bend in DNA upon binding. XPC:RAD23B stimulates the activity of DNA glycosylases TDG and SMUG1.	RAD23B

In this complex, acts as a GTPase-activating protein, by promoting GTP hydrolysis by eIF2G (EIF2S3) (PubMed:11166181). During scanning, interacts with both EIF1 (via its C-terminal domain (CTD)) and EIF1A (via its NTD) (PubMed:22813744). This interaction with EIF1A contributes to the maintenance of EIF1 within the open 43S PIC (PubMed:24319994). When start codon is recognized, EIF5, via its NTD, induces eIF2G (EIF2S3) to hydrolyze the GTP (PubMed:11166181). Start codon recognition also induces a conformational change of the PIC to a closed state (PubMed:22813744). This change increases the affinity of EIF5-CTD for EIF2-beta (EIF2S2), which allows the release, by an indirect mechanism, of EIF1 from the PIC (PubMed:22813744). Finally, EIF5 stabilizes the PIC in its closed conformation (PubMed:22813744). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11166181, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22813744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24319994}.	EIF5

Regulates cholesterol uptake through MYLIP-dependent ubiquitination of LDLR, VLDLR and LRP8; DLDLR and LRP8. Interplays functionally with RORA for the regulation of genes involved in liver metabolism (By similarity). Induces LPCAT3-dependent phospholipid remodeling in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes of hepatocytes, driving SREBF1 processing and lipogenesis (By similarity). Via LPCAT3, triggers the incorporation of arachidonate into phosphatidylcholines of ER membranes, increasing membrane dynamics and enabling triacylglycerols transfer to nascent very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles (By similarity). Via LPCAT3 also counteracts lipid-induced ER stress response and inflammation, likely by modulating SRC kinase membrane compartmentalization and limiting the synthesis of lipid inflammatory mediators (By similarity).

Catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step of ketone body utilization in extrahepatic tissues, by transferring coenzyme A (CoA) from a donor thiolester species (succinyl-CoA) to an acceptor carboxylate (acetoacetate), and produces acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA is further metabolized by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase into two acetyl-CoA molecules which enter the citric acid cycle for energy production (PubMed:10964512). Forms a dimeric enzyme where both of the subunits are able to form enzyme-CoA thiolester intermediates, but only one subunit is competent to transfer the CoA moiety to the acceptor carboxylate (3-oxo acid) and produce a new acyl-CoA. Formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate proceeds via an unstable anhydride species formed between the carboxylate groups of the enzyme and substrate (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q29551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10964512}.

P55895	RAG2_HUMAN	V(D)J recombination-activating protein 2 (RAG-2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	527	chromatin binding [GO:0003682]; methylated histone binding [GO:0035064]; phosphatidylinositol binding [GO:0035091]; phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate binding [GO:0005547]; phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate binding [GO:0043325]; phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0080025]; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding [GO:0005546]; sequence-specific DNA binding [GO:0043565]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]	FUNCTION: Core component of the RAG complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the DNA cleavage phase during V(D)J recombination. V(D)J recombination assembles a diverse repertoire of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes in developing B and T-lymphocytes through rearrangement of different V (variable), in some cases D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments. DNA cleavage by the RAG complex occurs in 2 steps: a first nick is introduced in the top strand immediately upstream of the heptamer, generating a 3'-hydroxyl group that can attack the phosphodiester bond on the opposite strand in a direct transesterification reaction, thereby creating 4 DNA ends: 2 hairpin coding ends and 2 blunt, 5'-phosphorylated ends. The chromatin structure plays an essential role in the V(D)J recombination reactions and the presence of histone H3 trimethylated at 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) stimulates both the nicking and haipinning steps. The RAG complex also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. The introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele induces ATM-dependent repositioning of the other allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. In the RAG complex, RAG2 is not the catalytic component but is required for all known catalytic activities mediated by RAG1. It probably acts as a sensor of chromatin state that recruits the RAG complex to H3K4me3 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.	RAG2

Furthermore, this enzyme can also act as a cytosolic inositol 3-phosphatase acting on Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5/inositol 1,3,4,5,6 pentakisphosphate and possibly Ins(1,3,4,5)P4/1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (PubMed:11418101, PubMed:15979280). Antagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival (PubMed:31492966, PubMed:37279284). The unphosphorylated form cooperates with MAGI2 to suppress AKT1 activation (PubMed:11707428). In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement (PubMed:22279049). Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (PubMed:22279049). Required for growth factor-induced epithelial cell migration; growth factor stimulation induces PTEN phosphorylation which changes its binding preference from the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI3K kinase complex to DLC1 and results in translocation of the PTEN-DLC1 complex to the posterior of migrating cells to promote RHOA activation (PubMed:26166433). Meanwhile, TNS3 switches binding preference from DLC1 to p85 and the TNS3-p85 complex translocates to the leading edge of migrating cells to activate RAC1 activation (PubMed:26166433). Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity).

Acts as a direct caspase inhibitor (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:12620238). Directly bind to the active site pocket of CASP3 and CASP7 and obstructs substrate entry (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:16352606, PubMed:16916640). Inactivates CASP9 by keeping it in a monomeric, inactive state (PubMed:12620238). Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating NF-kappa-B signaling and the target proteins for its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity include: RIPK1, RIPK2, MAP3K2/MEKK2, DIABLO/SMAC, AIFM1, CCS, PTEN and BIRC5/survivin (PubMed:17560374, PubMed:17967870, PubMed:19473982, PubMed:20154138, PubMed:22103349, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Acts as an important regulator of innate immunity by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 downstream of NOD1 and NOD2, thereby transforming RIPK2 into a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors, ultimately leading to activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAP kinases signaling (PubMed:19667203, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 also promotes recruitment of the LUBAC complex to RIPK2 (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636). Regulates the BMP signaling pathway and the SMAD and MAP3K7/TAK1 dependent pathways leading to NF-kappa-B and JNK activation (PubMed:17560374). Ubiquitination of CCS leads to enhancement of its chaperone activity toward its physiologic target, SOD1, rather than proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20154138). Ubiquitination of MAP3K2/MEKK2 and AIFM1 does not lead to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17967870, PubMed:22103349). Plays a role in copper homeostasis by ubiquitinating COMMD1 and promoting its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:14685266). Can also function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, targeting effector caspases for neddylation and inactivation (PubMed:21145488). Ubiquitinates and therefore mediates the proteasomal degradation of BCL2 in response to apoptosis (PubMed:29020630). Protects cells from spontaneous formation of the ripoptosome, a large multi-protein complex that has the capability to kill cancer cells in a caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manner (PubMed:22095281). Suppresses ripoptosome formation by ubiquitinating RIPK1 and CASP8 (PubMed:22095281). Acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling and ubiquitinates TLE1, TLE2, TLE3, TLE4 and AES (PubMed:22304967). Ubiquitination of TLE3 results in inhibition of its interaction with TCF7L2/TCF4 thereby allowing efficient recruitment and binding of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin to TCF7L2/TCF4 that is required to initiate a Wnt-specific transcriptional program (PubMed:22304967). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257230, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11257231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11447297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12121969, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12620238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14685266, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16352606, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16916640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17967870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19473982, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19667203, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20154138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21145488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22103349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22304967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22607974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29020630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29452636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30026309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9230442, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22095281}.

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p50 and RelB-p52 complexes are transcriptional activators. RELB neither associates with DNA nor with RELA/p65 or REL. Stimulates promoter activity in the presence of NFKB2/p49. As a member of the NUPR1/RELB/IER3 survival pathway, may provide pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with remarkable resistance to cell stress, such as starvation or gemcitabine treatment.

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 and RELA-REL complexes, for instance, function as transcriptional activators. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. The inhibitory effect of I-kappa-B on NF-kappa-B through retention in the cytoplasm is exerted primarily through the interaction with RELA. RELA shows a weak DNA-binding site which could contribute directly to DNA binding in the NF-kappa-B complex. Beside its activity as a direct transcriptional activator, it is also able to modulate promoters accessibility to transcription factors and thereby indirectly regulate gene expression. Associates with chromatin at the NF-kappa-B promoter region via association with DDX1. Essential for cytokine gene expression in T-cells (PubMed:15790681). The NF-kappa-B homodimeric RELA-RELA complex appears to be involved in invasin-mediated activation of IL-8 expression. Key transcription factor regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection (PubMed:33440148). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10928981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12748188, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15790681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17000776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17620405, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19058135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19103749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33440148}.

Upon binding of ligands such as BMP7 or GDF2/BMP9 to the heteromeric complexes, type II receptors transphosphorylate ACVR1 intracellular domain (PubMed:25354296). In turn, ACVR1 kinase domain is activated and subsequently phosphorylates SMAD1/5/8 proteins that transduce the signal (PubMed:9748228). In addition to its role in mediating BMP pathway-specific signaling, suppresses TGFbeta/activin pathway signaling by interfering with the binding of activin to its type II receptor (PubMed:17911401).

Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in macrophages, or following mitogenic stimuli, functions downstream of PI3K to activate MAP2K1/MEK1-MAPK1/ERK2 signaling cascade independently of RAF1 activation. Required for insulin-dependent activation of AKT3, but may function as an adapter rather than a direct activator. Upon insulin treatment may act as a downstream effector of PI3K and contribute to the activation of translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 and subsequent glucose transport in adipocytes. In EGF-induced cells, binds and activates MAP2K5/MEK5-MAPK7/ERK5 independently of its kinase activity and can activate JUN promoter through MEF2C. Through binding with SQSTM1/p62, functions in interleukin-1 signaling and activation of NF-kappa-B with the specific adapters RIPK1 and TRAF6. Participates in TNF-dependent transactivation of NF-kappa-B by phosphorylating and activating IKBKB kinase, which in turn leads to the degradation of NF-kappa-B inhibitors. In migrating astrocytes, forms a cytoplasmic complex with PARD6A and is recruited by CDC42 to function in the establishment of cell polarity along with the microtubule motor and dynein. In association with FEZ1, stimulates neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. In the inflammatory response, is required for the T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation process, including interleukin production, efficient activation of JAK1 and the subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6. May be involved in development of allergic airway inflammation (asthma), a process dependent on Th2 immune response. In the NF-kappa-B-mediated inflammatory response, can relieve SETD6-dependent repression of NF-kappa-B target genes by phosphorylating the RELA subunit at 'Ser-311'.

Catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine in beta 1-4 linkage to the beta-linked mannose of the trimannosyl core of N-linked sugar chains, called bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). It is one of the most important enzymes involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of glycoprotein oligosaccharides. The addition of this bisecting GlcNAc residue alters not only the composition, but also the conformation of the N-glycan. The introduction of the bisecting GlcNAc residue results in the suppression of further processing and elongation of N-glycans, precluding the formation of beta-1,6 GlcNAc branching, catalyzed by MGAT5 since it is unable to use the bisected oligosaccharide as a substrate (PubMed:19403558). Addition of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine to CDH1/E-cadherin modulates CDH1 cell membrane location (PubMed:19403558). Inhibits NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc- formation which modulates sialylation levels and plays a role in cell migration regulation (PubMed:26801611). In brain, addition of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine to BACE1 blocks its lysosomal targeting in response to oxidative stress and further degradation which increases its location to early endosome and the APP cleavage (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q10470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19403558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26801611}.

Q09470	KCNA1_HUMAN	Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1 (Voltage-gated K(+) channel HuKI) (Voltage-gated potassium channel HBK1) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	495	delayed rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0005251]; disordered domain specific binding [GO:0097718]; voltage-gated monoatomic ion channel activity involved in regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential [GO:1905030]; voltage-gated monoatomic ion channel activity involved in regulation of presynaptic membrane potential [GO:0099508]; voltage-gated potassium channel activity [GO:0005249]	FUNCTION: Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in the brain and the central nervous system, but also in the kidney (PubMed:19903818, PubMed:8845167). Contributes to the regulation of the membrane potential and nerve signaling, and prevents neuronal hyperexcitability (PubMed:17156368). Forms tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (PubMed:19912772). Can form functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5, KCNA6, KCNA7, and possibly other family members as well; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel (PubMed:12077175, PubMed:17156368). Channel properties are modulated by cytoplasmic beta subunits that regulate the subcellular location of the alpha subunits and promote rapid inactivation of delayed rectifier potassium channels (PubMed:12077175, PubMed:17156368). In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign currents observed in intact tissues to any particular potassium channel family member. Homotetrameric KCNA1 forms a delayed-rectifier potassium channel that opens in response to membrane depolarization, followed by slow spontaneous channel closure (PubMed:19307729, PubMed:19903818, PubMed:19912772, PubMed:19968958). In contrast, a heterotetrameric channel formed by KCNA1 and KCNA4 shows rapid inactivation (PubMed:17156368). Regulates neuronal excitability in hippocampus, especially in mossy fibers and medial perforant path axons, preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. Response to toxins that are selective for KCNA1, respectively for KCNA2, suggests that heteromeric potassium channels composed of both KCNA1 and KCNA2 play a role in pacemaking and regulate the output of deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (By similarity). May function as down-stream effector for G protein-coupled receptors and inhibit GABAergic inputs to basolateral amygdala neurons (By similarity). May contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release (By similarity). Plays a role in regulating the generation of action potentials and preventing hyperexcitability in myelinated axons of the vagus nerve, and thereby contributes to the regulation of heart contraction (By similarity). Required for normal neuromuscular responses (PubMed:11026449, PubMed:17136396). Regulates the frequency of neuronal action potential firing in response to mechanical stimuli, and plays a role in the perception of pain caused by mechanical stimuli, but does not play a role in the perception of pain due to heat stimuli (By similarity). Required for normal responses to auditory stimuli and precise location of sound sources, but not for sound perception (By similarity). The use of toxins that block specific channels suggest that it contributes to the regulation of the axonal release of the neurotransmitter dopamine (By similarity). Required for normal postnatal brain development and normal proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the brain (By similarity). Plays a role in the reabsorption of Mg(2+) in the distal convoluted tubules in the kidney and in magnesium ion homeostasis, probably via its effect on the membrane potential (PubMed:19307729, PubMed:23903368). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P10499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11026449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12077175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15837928, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17136396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17156368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19307729, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19903818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19912772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19968958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21106501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23903368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8845167}.

In TLR and RLR signaling pathways, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting the synthesis of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains on several substrates such as ASC that lead to the activation of the type I interferon response or the inflammasome (PubMed:25847972, PubMed:27980081). Following the activation of certain TLRs such as TLR4, acts as a negative NF-kappa-B regulator, possibly to avoid unregulated inflammatory response, and its degradation via 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination is required for MAPK activation and production of inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, when TLR4 orchestrates bacterial expulsion, TRAF3 undergoes 'Lys-33'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequently binds to RALGDS, mobilizing the exocyst complex to rapidly expel intracellular bacteria back for clearance (PubMed:27438768). Acts also as a constitutive negative regulator of the alternative NF-kappa-B pathway, which controls B-cell survival and lymphoid organ development.

Cannot remove 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). According to an alternative model, involved in DNA demethylation by mediating DNA glycolase activity toward 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) produced by deamination of 5hmC. Also involved in DNA repair by acting as a thymine-DNA glycosylase that mediates correction of G/T mispairs to G/C pairs: in the DNA of higher eukaryotes, hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine leads to the formation of G/T mismatches. Its role in the repair of canonical base damage is however minor compared to its role in DNA demethylation. It is capable of hydrolyzing the carbon-nitrogen bond between the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA and a mispaired thymine. In addition to the G/T, it can remove thymine also from C/T and T/T mispairs in the order G/T >> C/T > T/T. It has no detectable activity on apyrimidinic sites and does not catalyze the removal of thymine from A/T pairs or from single-stranded DNA. It can also remove uracil and 5-bromouracil from mispairs with guanine. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21862836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22327402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22573813, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22962365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8127859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8407958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8662714}.

Upon binding to IL10, induces a conformational change in IL10RB, allowing IL10RB to bind IL10 as well (PubMed:16982608). In turn, the heterotetrameric assembly complex, composed of two subunits of IL10RA and IL10RB, activates the kinases JAK1 and TYK2 that are constitutively associated with IL10RA and IL10RB respectively (PubMed:12133952). These kinases then phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain in IL10RA leading to the recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3. Once phosphorylated, STAT3 homodimerizes, translocates to the nucleus and activates the expression of anti-inflammatory genes. In addition, IL10RA-mediated activation of STAT3 inhibits starvation-induced autophagy (PubMed:26962683). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12133952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26962683}.

Transduces the activin signal from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and is thus regulating many physiological and pathological processes including neuronal differentiation and neuronal survival, hair follicle development and cycling, FSH production by the pituitary gland, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, immunosuppression and carcinogenesis. Activin is also thought to have a paracrine or autocrine role in follicular development in the ovary. Within the receptor complex, the type-2 receptors act as a primary activin receptors (binds activin-A/INHBA, activin-B/INHBB as well as inhibin-A/INHA-INHBA). The type-1 receptors like ACVR1B act as downstream transducers of activin signals. Activin binds to type-2 receptor at the plasma membrane and activates its serine-threonine kinase. The activated receptor type-2 then phosphorylates and activates the type-1 receptor. Once activated, the type-1 receptor binds and phosphorylates the SMAD proteins SMAD2 and SMAD3, on serine residues of the C-terminal tail. Soon after their association with the activin receptor and subsequent phosphorylation, SMAD2 and SMAD3 are released into the cytoplasm where they interact with the common partner SMAD4. This SMAD complex translocates into the nucleus where it mediates activin-induced transcription. Inhibitory SMAD7, which is recruited to ACVR1B through FKBP1A, can prevent the association of SMAD2 and SMAD3 with the activin receptor complex, thereby blocking the activin signal. Activin signal transduction is also antagonized by the binding to the receptor of inhibin-B via the IGSF1 inhibin coreceptor. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622651}.	ACVR2B

The TREX complex is recruited to spliced mRNAs by a transcription-independent mechanism, binds to mRNA upstream of the exon-junction complex (EJC) and is recruited in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner to a region near the 5' end of the mRNA where it functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP/NXF1 pathway (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). The THOC1-THOC2-THOC3 core complex alone is sufficient to promote ATPase activity of DDX39B; in the complex THOC2 is the only component that directly interacts with DDX39B (PubMed:33191911). Associates with SARNP/CIP29, which facilitates RNA binding of DDX39B and likely plays a role in mRNA export (PubMed:37578863). May undergo several rounds of ATP hydrolysis during assembly of TREX to drive subsequent loading of components such as ALYREF/THOC4 and CHTOP onto mRNA. Also associates with pre-mRNA independent of ALYREF/THOC4. Involved in the nuclear export of intronless mRNA; the ATP-bound form is proposed to recruit export adapter ALYREF/THOC4 to intronless mRNA; its ATPase activity is cooperatively stimulated by RNA and ALYREF/THOC4 and ATP hydrolysis is thought to trigger the dissociation from RNA to allow the association of ALYREF/THOC4 and the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer. Involved in transcription elongation and genome stability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11675789, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15585580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15833825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15998806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17190602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17562711, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17984224, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20844015, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22144908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23222130, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23299939, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33191911, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37578863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9242493}.; FUNCTION: Splice factor that is required for the first ATP-dependent step in spliceosome assembly and for the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branchpoint. Has both RNA-stimulated ATP binding/hydrolysis activity and ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. Even with the stimulation of RNA, the ATPase activity is weak. Can only hydrolyze ATP but not other NTPs. The RNA stimulation of ATPase activity does not have a strong preference for the sequence and length of the RNA. However, ssRNA stimulates the ATPase activity much more strongly than dsRNA. Can unwind 5' or 3' overhangs or blunt end RNA duplexes in vitro. The ATPase and helicase activities are not influenced by U2AF2; the effect of ALYREF/THOC4 is reported conflictingly with [PubMed:23299939] reporting a stimulatory effect. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23299939, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9242493}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) The TREX complex is essential for the export of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) intronless mRNAs and infectious virus production. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18974867}.

Function seems to be context dependent and differ depending on cell type, as well as its intracellular localization. A number of potential nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates have been identified. These include the RNA-binding proteins: KHDRBS1/SAM68, KHDRBS2/SLM1, KHDRBS3/SLM2 and SFPQ/PSF; transcription factors: STAT3 and STAT5A/B and a variety of signaling molecules: ARHGAP35/p190RhoGAP, PXN/paxillin, BTK/ATK, STAP2/BKS. Associates also with a variety of proteins that are likely upstream of PTK6 in various signaling pathways, or for which PTK6 may play an adapter-like role. These proteins include ADAM15, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3 and IRS4. In normal or non-tumorigenic tissues, PTK6 promotes cellular differentiation and apoptosis. In tumors PTK6 contributes to cancer progression by sensitizing cells to mitogenic signals and enhancing proliferation, anchorage-independent survival and migration/invasion. Association with EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3 may contribute to mammary tumor development and growth through enhancement of EGF-induced signaling via BTK/AKT and PI3 kinase. Contributes to migration and proliferation by contributing to EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ARHGAP35/p190RhoGAP, which promotes association with RASA1/p120RasGAP, inactivating RhoA while activating RAS. EGF stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of PNX/Paxillin by PTK6 and activation of RAC1 via CRK/CrKII, thereby promoting migration and invasion. PTK6 activates STAT3 and STAT5B to promote proliferation. Nuclear PTK6 may be important for regulating growth in normal epithelia, while cytoplasmic PTK6 might activate oncogenic signaling pathways.; FUNCTION: Isoform 2 inhibits PTK6 phosphorylation and PTK6 association with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.

More than 95% of the BAs are N-acyl amidates with glycine and taurine (PubMed:8034703). Amidation of BAs in the liver with glycine or taurine prior to their excretion into bile is an important biochemical event in bile acid metabolism (PubMed:12810727). This conjugation (or amidation) plays several important biological roles in that it promotes the secretion of BAs and cholesterol into bile and increases the detergent properties of BAs in the intestine, which facilitates lipid and vitamin absorption (PubMed:12810727).

As a component of the trimeric and tetrameric DNA polymerase delta complexes (Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4, respectively), plays a role in high fidelity genome replication, including in lagging strand synthesis, and repair. Required for optimal Pol-delta activity. Stabilizes the Pol-delta complex and plays a major role in Pol-delta stimulation by PCNA (PubMed:10219083, PubMed:10852724, PubMed:11595739, PubMed:16510448, PubMed:24035200). Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 are characterized by the absence or the presence of POLD4. They exhibit differences in catalytic activity. Most notably, Pol-delta3 shows higher proofreading activity than Pol-delta4 (PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433). Although both Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 process Okazaki fragments in vitro, Pol-delta3 may also be better suited to fulfill this task, exhibiting near-absence of strand displacement activity compared to Pol-delta4 and stalling on encounter with the 5'-blocking oligonucleotides.

Along with DNA polymerase kappa, DNA polymerase delta carries out approximately half of nucleotide excision repair (NER) synthesis following UV irradiation. In this context, POLD3, along with PCNA and RFC1-replication factor C complex, is required to recruit POLD1, the catalytic subunit of the polymerase delta complex, to DNA damage sites (PubMed:20227374).

Advanced glycosylation end products are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes (PubMed:21565706). These ligands accumulate at inflammatory sites during the pathogenesis of various diseases, including diabetes, vascular complications, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancers and RAGE transduces their binding into pro-inflammatory responses. Upon ligand binding, uses TIRAP and MYD88 as adapters to transduce the signal ultimately leading to the induction or inflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8 and TNFalpha through activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21829704, PubMed:33436632). Interaction with S100A12 on endothelium, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes triggers cellular activation, with generation of key pro-inflammatory mediators (PubMed:19386136). Interaction with S100B after myocardial infarction may play a role in myocyte apoptosis by activating ERK1/2 and p53/TP53 signaling (By similarity). Contributes to the translocation of amyloid-beta peptide (ABPP) across the cell membrane from the extracellular to the intracellular space in cortical neurons (PubMed:19906677). ABPP-initiated RAGE signaling, especially stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), has the capacity to drive a transport system delivering ABPP as a complex with RAGE to the intraneuronal space. Participates in endothelial albumin transcytosis together with HMGB1 through the RAGE/SRC/Caveolin-1 pathway, leading to endothelial hyperpermeability (PubMed:27572515). Mediates the loading of HMGB1 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that shuttle HMGB1 to hepatocytes by transferrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequently promote hepatocyte pyroptosis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:34743181). Promotes also extracellular hypomethylated DNA (CpG DNA) uptake by cells via the endosomal route to activate inflammatory responses (PubMed:24081950, PubMed:28515150). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19906677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20943659, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21559403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21565706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21829704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24081950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27572515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28515150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33436632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34743181}.

Plays an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis, endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion and cell spreading, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, but also maintenance of vascular quiescence. Required for normal angiogenesis and heart development during embryogenesis. After birth, activates or inhibits angiogenesis, depending on the context. Inhibits angiogenesis and promotes vascular stability in quiescent vessels, where endothelial cells have tight contacts. In quiescent vessels, ANGPT1 oligomers recruit TEK to cell-cell contacts, forming complexes with TEK molecules from adjoining cells, and this leads to preferential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the AKT1 signaling cascades. In migrating endothelial cells that lack cell-cell adhesions, ANGT1 recruits TEK to contacts with the extracellular matrix, leading to the formation of focal adhesion complexes, activation of PTK2/FAK and of the downstream kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, and ultimately to the stimulation of sprouting angiogenesis.

Q16526	CRY1_HUMAN	Cryptochrome-1	Homo sapiens (Human)	586	blue light photoreceptor activity [GO:0009882]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; double-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003690]; E-box binding [GO:0070888]; FAD binding [GO:0071949]; histone deacetylase binding [GO:0042826]; nuclear receptor binding [GO:0016922]; phosphatase binding [GO:0019902]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]	FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptional repressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effective in lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2 seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development of intercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. Capable of translocating circadian clock core proteins such as PER proteins to the nucleus. Interacts with CLOCK-BMAL1 independently of PER proteins and is found at CLOCK-BMAL1-bound sites, suggesting that CRY may act as a molecular gatekeeper to maintain CLOCK-BMAL1 in a poised and repressed state until the proper time for transcriptional activation. Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced transcription of ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and NAMPT (By similarity). May repress circadian target genes expression in collaboration with HDAC1 and HDAC2 through histone deacetylation. Mediates the clock-control activation of ATR and modulates ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. In liver, mediates circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis by binding to membrane-coupled G proteins and blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and CREB1 phosphorylation. Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing nuclear FOXO1 levels that down-regulates gluconeogenic gene expression (By similarity). Besides its role in the maintenance of the circadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of other processes. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism modulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4 (By similarity). Represses PPARD and its target genes in the skeletal muscle and limits exercise capacity (By similarity). Plays an essential role in the generation of circadian rhythms in the retina (By similarity). Represses the transcriptional activity of NR1I2 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10531061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14672706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22170608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23133559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28388406}.

CFIm contributes to the recruitment of multiprotein complexes on specific sequences on the pre-mRNA 3'-end, so called cleavage and polyadenylation signals (pA signals) (PubMed:14690600, PubMed:8626397, PubMed:9659921). Most pre-mRNAs contain multiple pA signals, resulting in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) producing mRNAs with variable 3'-end formation (PubMed:23187700, PubMed:29276085). The CFIm complex acts as a key regulator of cleavage and polyadenylation site choice during APA through its binding to 5'-UGUA-3' elements localized in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) for a huge number of pre-mRNAs (PubMed:20695905, PubMed:29276085). CPSF6 enhances NUDT21/CPSF5 binding to 5'-UGUA-3' elements localized upstream of pA signals and promotes RNA looping, and hence activates directly the mRNA 3'-processing machinery (PubMed:15169763, PubMed:21295486, PubMed:29276085).

Q49AN0	CRY2_HUMAN	Cryptochrome-2	Homo sapiens (Human)	593	blue light photoreceptor activity [GO:0009882]; damaged DNA binding [GO:0003684]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; FAD binding [GO:0071949]; nuclear receptor binding [GO:0016922]; phosphatase binding [GO:0019902]; protein kinase binding [GO:0019901]; single-stranded DNA binding [GO:0003697]; transcription cis-regulatory region binding [GO:0000976]	FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian transcriptional outputs. Less potent transcriptional repressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY1, though less effective in lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. Seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of CRY1. With CRY1, dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development of intercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. May mediate circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and in CREB1 phosphorylation. Besides its role in the maintenance of the circadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of other processes. Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism modulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4. Represses glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1.

The 7SK RNP complex sequesters the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in a large inactive 7SK RNP complex preventing RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and subsequent transcriptional elongation (PubMed:18249148, PubMed:18483487).

Acts as a lysyl-hydroxylase that catalyzes 5-hydroxylation on specific lysine residues of target proteins such as U2AF2/U2AF65 and LUC7L2. Regulates RNA splicing by mediating 5-hydroxylation of U2AF2/U2AF65, affecting the pre-mRNA splicing activity of U2AF2/U2AF65 (PubMed:19574390). Hydroxylates its own N-terminus, which is required for homooligomerization (PubMed:22189873). Plays a role in the regulation of nucleolar liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) by post-translationally modifying LIAT1 at its lysine-rich domain which inhibits LIAT1 nucleolar targeting (By similarity). In addition to peptidyl-lysine 5-dioxygenase activity, may act as an RNA hydroxylase, as suggested by its ability to bind single strand RNA (PubMed:20679243, PubMed:29176719). Also acts as an arginine demethylase which preferentially demethylates asymmetric dimethylation (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:24360279, PubMed:24498420). Demethylates histone H3 at 'Arg-2' (H3R2me) and histone H4 at 'Arg-3' (H4R3me), including mono-, symmetric di- and asymmetric dimethylated forms, thereby playing a role in histone code (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:24360279). However, histone arginine demethylation may not constitute the primary activity in vivo (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:21060799, PubMed:22189873). In collaboration with BRD4, interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex in its active form to regulate polymerase II promoter-proximal pause release for transcriptional activation of a large cohort of genes. On distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers, demethylates both histone H4R3me2 and the methyl cap of 7SKsnRNA leading to the dismissal of the 7SKsnRNA:HEXIM1 inhibitor complex. After removal of repressive marks, the complex BRD4:JMJD6 attract and retain the P-TEFb complex on chromatin, leading to its activation, promoter-proximal polymerase II pause release, and transcriptional activation (PubMed:24360279). Demethylates other arginine methylated-proteins such as ESR1 (PubMed:24498420). Has no histone lysine demethylase activity (PubMed:21060799).

Catalyzes transfer of the fatty acyl chain from fatty acyl-CoA to 1-acyl lysophospholipid to form various classes of phospholipids. Converts 1-acyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into phosphatidylcholine (PC) (LPCAT activity), 1-acyl lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) into phosphatidylserine (PS) (LPSAT activity) and 1-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (LPEAT activity) (PubMed:18195019, PubMed:18772128, PubMed:18782225). Favors polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs as acyl donors compared to saturated fatty acyl-CoAs (PubMed:18195019, PubMed:18772128). Has higher activity for LPC acyl acceptors compared to LPEs and LPSs. Can also transfer the fatty acyl chain from fatty acyl-CoA to 1-O-alkyl lysophospholipid or 1-O-alkenyl lysophospholipid with lower efficiency (By similarity). Acts as a major LPC O-acyltransferase in liver and intestine. As a component of the liver X receptor/NR1H3 or NR1H2 signaling pathway, mainly catalyzes the incorporation of arachidonate into PCs of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, increasing membrane dynamics and enabling triacylglycerols transfer to nascent very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. Promotes processing of sterol regulatory protein SREBF1 in hepatocytes, likely by facilitating the translocation of SREBF1-SCAP complex from ER to the Golgi apparatus (By similarity). Participates in mechanisms by which the liver X receptor/NR1H3 or NR1H2 signaling pathway counteracts lipid-induced ER stress response and inflammation. Down-regulates hepatic inflammation by limiting arachidonic acid availability for synthesis of inflammatory eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins (By similarity). In enterocytes, acts as a component of a gut-brain feedback loop that coordinates dietary lipid absorption and food intake. Regulates the abundance of PCs containing linoleate and arachidonate in enterocyte membranes, enabling passive diffusion of fatty acids and cholesterol across the membrane for efficient chylomicron assembly (By similarity).

May be involved in cell cycle progression through the regulation of cyclin D1/PRAD1 expression. Component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C) which has multiple functions during transcription by RNA polymerase II and is implicated in regulation of development and maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency. PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II through interaction with POLR2A CTD non-phosphorylated and 'Ser-2'- and 'Ser-5'-phosphorylated forms and is involved in transcriptional elongation, acting both independently and synergistically with TCEA1 and in cooperation with the DSIF complex and HTATSF1. PAF1C is required for transcription of Hox and Wnt target genes. PAF1C is involved in hematopoiesis and stimulates transcriptional activity of KMT2A/MLL1; it promotes leukemogenesis through association with KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged oncoproteins, such as KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT3/AF9 and KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT1/ENL. PAF1C is involved in histone modifications such as ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3). PAF1C recruits the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and the E2 enzyme UBE2A or UBE2B to chromatin which mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B (H2BK120ub1); UB2A/B-mediated H2B ubiquitination is proposed to be coupled to transcription. PAF1C is involved in mRNA 3' end formation probably through association with cleavage and poly(A) factors. In case of infection by influenza A strain H3N2, PAF1C associates with viral NS1 protein, thereby regulating gene transcription.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Stimulates nuclear receptor mediated transcription. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6P9Z1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29374058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8804307, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.

M6A is a modification present at internal sites of mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs and plays a role in mRNA stability and processing (PubMed:22575960, PubMed:24284625, PubMed:28106072, PubMed:28281539, PubMed:32492408). Acts as a regulator of mRNA stability by promoting degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex or PAN3 (PubMed:32492408). The YTHDF paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) share m6A-containing mRNAs targets and act redundantly to mediate mRNA degradation and cellular differentiation (PubMed:28106072, PubMed:28106076, PubMed:32492408).

Recognizes and binds m6A-containing circular RNAs (circRNAs); circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, a non-canonical splicing process promoted by dsRNA structures across circularizing exons (PubMed:28281539). Promotes formation of phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies or stress granules, by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation upon binding to mRNAs containing multiple m6A-modified residues: polymethylated mRNAs act as a multivalent scaffold for the binding of YTHDF proteins, juxtaposing their disordered regions and thereby leading to phase separation (PubMed:31292544, PubMed:31388144, PubMed:32451507). The resulting mRNA-YTHDF complexes then partition into different endogenous phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies, stress granules or neuronal RNA granules (PubMed:31292544).

The protease activity is required for proteolytic activation of ATG8 family proteins: cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 proteins MAP1LC3 and GABARAPL2, to reveal a C-terminal glycine (PubMed:21177865). Exposure of the glycine at the C-terminus is essential for ATG8 proteins conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and insertion to membranes, which is necessary for autophagy (By similarity). In addition to the protease activity, also mediates delipidation of ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:33909989). Catalyzes delipidation of PE-conjugated forms of ATG8 proteins during macroautophagy (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:33909989). Also involved in non-canonical autophagy, a parallel pathway involving conjugation of ATG8 proteins to single membranes at endolysosomal compartments, by catalyzing delipidation of ATG8 proteins conjugated to phosphatidylserine (PS) (PubMed:33909989). ATG4D plays a role in the autophagy-mediated neuronal homeostasis in the central nervous system (By similarity). Compared to other members of the family (ATG4A, ATG4B or ATG4C), constitutes the major protein for the delipidation activity, while it promotes weak proteolytic activation of ATG8 proteins (By similarity). Involved in phagophore growth during mitophagy independently of its protease activity and of ATG8 proteins: acts by regulating ATG9A trafficking to mitochondria and promoting phagophore-endoplasmic reticulum contacts during the lipid transfer phase of mitophagy (PubMed:33773106). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8BGV9, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Y4P1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21177865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29458288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30661429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33773106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33909989}.; FUNCTION: [Cysteine protease ATG4D, mitochondrial]: Plays a role as an autophagy regulator that links mitochondrial dysfunction with apoptosis.

Q86U44	MTA70_HUMAN	N(6)-adenosine-methyltransferase catalytic subunit METTL3 (EC 2.1.1.348) (Methyltransferase-like protein 3) (hMETTL3) (N(6)-adenosine-methyltransferase 70 kDa subunit) (MT-A70)	Homo sapiens (Human)	580	mRNA binding [GO:0003729]; mRNA m(6)A methyltransferase activity [GO:0001734]; protein heterodimerization activity [GO:0046982]; RNA methyltransferase activity [GO:0008173]; S-adenosyl-L-methionine binding [GO:1904047]	FUNCTION: The METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer forms a N6-methyltransferase complex that methylates adenosine residues at the N(6) position of some RNAs and regulates various processes such as the circadian clock, differentiation of embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells, cortical neurogenesis, response to DNA damage, differentiation of T-cells and primary miRNA processing (PubMed:22575960, PubMed:24284625, PubMed:25719671, PubMed:25799998, PubMed:26321680, PubMed:26593424, PubMed:27281194, PubMed:27373337, PubMed:27627798, PubMed:28297716, PubMed:29348140, PubMed:29506078, PubMed:30428350, PubMed:9409616). In the heterodimer formed with METTL14, METTL3 constitutes the catalytic core (PubMed:27281194, PubMed:27373337, PubMed:27627798). N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which takes place at the 5'-[AG]GAC-3' consensus sites of some mRNAs, plays a role in mRNA stability, processing, translation efficiency and editing (PubMed:22575960, PubMed:24284625, PubMed:25719671, PubMed:25799998, PubMed:26321680, PubMed:26593424, PubMed:28297716, PubMed:9409616). M6A acts as a key regulator of mRNA stability: methylation is completed upon the release of mRNA into the nucleoplasm and promotes mRNA destabilization and degradation (PubMed:28637692). In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), m6A methylation of mRNAs encoding key naive pluripotency-promoting transcripts results in transcript destabilization, promoting differentiation of ESCs (By similarity). M6A regulates the length of the circadian clock: acts as an early pace-setter in the circadian loop by putting mRNA production on a fast-track for facilitating nuclear processing, thereby providing an early point of control in setting the dynamics of the feedback loop (By similarity). M6A also regulates circadian regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism (PubMed:30428350). M6A regulates spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis and is essential for male fertility and spermatogenesis (By similarity). Also required for oogenesis (By similarity). Involved in the response to DNA damage: in response to ultraviolet irradiation, METTL3 rapidly catalyzes the formation of m6A on poly(A) transcripts at DNA damage sites, leading to the recruitment of POLK to DNA damage sites (PubMed:28297716). M6A is also required for T-cell homeostasis and differentiation: m6A methylation of transcripts of SOCS family members (SOCS1, SOCS3 and CISH) in naive T-cells promotes mRNA destabilization and degradation, promoting T-cell differentiation (By similarity). Inhibits the type I interferon response by mediating m6A methylation of IFNB (PubMed:30559377). M6A also takes place in other RNA molecules, such as primary miRNA (pri-miRNAs) (PubMed:25799998). Mediates m6A methylation of Xist RNA, thereby participating in random X inactivation: m6A methylation of Xist leads to target YTHDC1 reader on Xist and promote transcription repression activity of Xist (PubMed:27602518). M6A also regulates cortical neurogenesis: m6A methylation of transcripts related to transcription factors, neural stem cells, the cell cycle and neuronal differentiation during brain development promotes their destabilization and decay, promoting differentiation of radial glial cells (By similarity). METTL3 mediates methylation of pri-miRNAs, marking them for recognition and processing by DGCR8 (PubMed:25799998). Acts as a positive regulator of mRNA translation independently of the methyltransferase activity: promotes translation by interacting with the translation initiation machinery in the cytoplasm (PubMed:27117702). Its overexpression in a number of cancer cells suggests that it may participate in cancer cell proliferation by promoting mRNA translation (PubMed:27117702). During human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection, adds m6A modifications in SARS-CoV-2 RNA leading to decreased RIGI binding and subsequently dampening the sensing and activation of innate immune responses (PubMed:33961823). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8C3P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22575960, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24284625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25719671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25799998, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26321680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26593424, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27117702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27281194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27373337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27602518, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27627798, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28297716, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28637692, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29348140, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29506078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30428350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30559377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33961823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9409616}.

Senses calcium level via its EF-hand domains: compared to MICU1 and MICU2, MICU3 has a higher affinity for calcium (PubMed:29725115). MICU1 and MICU3 form a disulfide-linked heterodimer that stimulates and inhibits MCU activity, depending on the concentration of calcium (PubMed:29725115). At low calcium levels, MICU1 occludes the pore of the MCU channel, preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake (PubMed:29725115). At higher calcium levels, calcium-binding to MICU1 and MICU3 induces a conformational change that weakens MCU-MICU1 interactions and moves the MICU1-MICU3 heterodimer away from the pore, allowing calcium permeation through the MCU channel (PubMed:29725115). The high calcium affinity of MICU3 lowers the calcium threshold necessary for calcium permeation through the MCU channel (PubMed:29725115). The MICU1-MICU3 heterodimer promotes flexibility of neurotransmission in neuronal cells by enhancing mitochondrial calcium uptake in presynapses (PubMed:29725115). It is also required to increase mitochondrial calcium uptake in skeletal muscle cells, thereby increasing ATP production (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9CTY5, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29725115}.

MICU1 and MICU2 form a disulfide-linked heterodimer that stimulates and inhibits MCU activity, depending on the concentration of calcium (PubMed:24560927, PubMed:26903221, PubMed:28615291, PubMed:30699349, PubMed:31397067, PubMed:32148862, PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847, PubMed:32790952). At low calcium levels, MICU1 occludes the pore of the MCU channel, preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake (PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847). At higher calcium levels, calcium-binding to MICU1 and MICU2 induces a conformational change that weakens MCU-MICU1 interactions and moves the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer away from the pore, allowing calcium permeation through the MCU channel (PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24503055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24560927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26903221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28615291, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30699349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31397067, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32148862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32494073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32667285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32762847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32790952}.

Acts with UBE2N/UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitination. Recruited to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs) by binding to ubiquitinated histone H2A and H2AX and amplifies the RNF8-dependent H2A ubiquitination, promoting the formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin conjugates. This leads to concentrate ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions to the threshold required for recruitment of TP53BP1 and BRCA1. Also recruited at DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) sites and promotes accumulation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, leading to recruitment of FAAP20/C1orf86 and Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, followed by interstrand cross-link repair. H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Also involved in class switch recombination in immune system, via its role in regulation of DSBs repair. Following DNA damage, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of JMJD2A/KDM4A in collaboration with RNF8, leading to unmask H4K20me2 mark and promote the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites. Not able to initiate 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination in vitro; possibly due to partial occlusion of the UBE2N/UBC13-binding region. Catalyzes monoubiquitination of 'Lys-13' and 'Lys-15' of nucleosomal histone H2A (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203578, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20550933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22373579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22705371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22713238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22742833, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22980979, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23760478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27153538}.

In non-stress conditions, interacts with cofactor JMY in the cytoplasm which prevents JMY's actin nucleation activity and ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex. Acts as a negative regulator of nutrient stress-induced autophagy by preventing JMY's interaction with MAP1LC3B, thereby preventing autophagosome formation (By similarity). Involves in tubulin autoregulation by promoting its degradation in response to excess soluble tubulin (PubMed:31727855). To do so, associates with the active ribosome near the ribosome exit tunnel and with nascent tubulin polypeptides early during their translation, triggering tubulin mRNA-targeted degradation (PubMed:31727855).

PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II through interaction with POLR2A CTD non-phosphorylated and 'Ser-2'- and 'Ser-5'-phosphorylated forms and is involved in transcriptional elongation, acting both independently and synergistically with TCEA1 and in cooperation with the DSIF complex and HTATSF1. PAF1C is required for transcription of Hox and Wnt target genes. PAF1C is involved in hematopoiesis and stimulates transcriptional activity of KMT2A/MLL1; it promotes leukemogenesis through association with KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged oncoproteins, such as KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT3/AF9 and KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT1/ENL. PAF1C is involved in histone modifications such as ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3). PAF1C recruits the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and the E2 enzyme UBE2A or UBE2B to chromatin which mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B (H2BK120ub1); UB2A/B-mediated H2B ubiquitination is proposed to be coupled to transcription. PAF1C is involved in mRNA 3' end formation probably through association with cleavage and poly(A) factors. In case of infection by influenza A strain H3N2, PAF1C associates with viral NS1 protein, thereby regulating gene transcription. Connects PAF1C with the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex.

Catalysis involves both the formation of a 2',5' phosphodiester linkage at the GpA step and the formation of a 3',5' phosphodiester linkage at the ApG step, producing c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p] (PubMed:28214358, PubMed:28363908). Acts as a key DNA sensor: directly binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), inducing the formation of liquid-like droplets in which CGAS is activated, leading to synthesis of 2',3'-cGAMP, a second messenger that binds to and activates STING1, thereby triggering type-I interferon production (PubMed:28314590, PubMed:28363908, PubMed:29976794, PubMed:32817552, PubMed:33230297, PubMed:33606975, PubMed:35322803, PubMed:35438208, PubMed:35460603, PubMed:35503863). Preferentially recognizes and binds curved long dsDNAs of a minimal length of 40 bp (PubMed:30007416). Acts as a key foreign DNA sensor, the presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm being a danger signal that triggers the immune responses (PubMed:28363908). Has antiviral activity by sensing the presence of dsDNA from DNA viruses in the cytoplasm (PubMed:28363908). Also acts as an innate immune sensor of infection by retroviruses, such as HIV-2, by detecting the presence of reverse-transcribed DNA in the cytosol (PubMed:23929945, PubMed:24269171, PubMed:30270045, PubMed:32852081). In contrast, HIV-1 is poorly sensed by CGAS, due to its capsid that cloaks viral DNA from CGAS detection (PubMed:24269171, PubMed:30270045, PubMed:32852081). Detection of retroviral reverse-transcribed DNA in the cytosol may be indirect and be mediated via interaction with PQBP1, which directly binds reverse-transcribed retroviral DNA (PubMed:26046437). Also detects the presence of DNA from bacteria, such as M.tuberculosis (PubMed:26048138). 2',3'-cGAMP can be transferred from producing cells to neighboring cells through gap junctions, leading to promote STING1 activation and convey immune response to connecting cells (PubMed:24077100). 2',3'-cGAMP can also be transferred between cells by virtue of packaging within viral particles contributing to IFN-induction in newly infected cells in a cGAS-independent but STING1-dependent manner (PubMed:26229115). Also senses the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are translocated to the cytosol following phagocytosis, leading to synthesis of 2',3'-cGAMP (PubMed:33688080). In addition to foreign DNA, can also be activated by endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889, PubMed:31299200, PubMed:33031745, PubMed:33230297). When self-DNA leaks into the cytosol during cellular stress (such as mitochondrial stress, SARS-CoV-2 infection causing severe COVID-19 disease, DNA damage, mitotic arrest or senescence), or is present in form of cytosolic micronuclei, CGAS is activated leading to a state of sterile inflammation (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889, PubMed:31299200, PubMed:33031745, PubMed:33230297, PubMed:35045565). Acts as a regulator of cellular senescence by binding to cytosolic chromatin fragments that are present in senescent cells, leading to trigger type-I interferon production via STING1 and promote cellular senescence (By similarity). Also involved in the inflammatory response to genome instability and double-stranded DNA breaks: acts by localizing to micronuclei arising from genome instability (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889). Micronuclei, which are frequently found in cancer cells, consist of chromatin surrounded by their own nuclear membrane: following breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, CGAS binds self-DNA exposed to the cytosol, leading to 2',3'-cGAMP synthesis and subsequent activation of STING1 and type-I interferon production (PubMed:28738408, PubMed:28759889). Activated in response to prolonged mitotic arrest, promoting mitotic cell death (PubMed:31299200). In a healthy cell, CGAS is however kept inactive even in cellular events that directly expose it to self-DNA, such as mitosis, when cGAS associates with chromatin directly after nuclear envelope breakdown or remains in the form of postmitotic persistent nuclear cGAS pools bound to chromatin (PubMed:31299200, PubMed:33542149). Nuclear CGAS is inactivated by chromatin via direct interaction with nucleosomes, which block CGAS from DNA binding and thus prevent CGAS-induced autoimmunity (PubMed:31299200, PubMed:32911482, PubMed:32912999, PubMed:33051594, PubMed:33542149). Also acts as a suppressor of DNA repair in response to DNA damage: inhibits homologous recombination repair by interacting with PARP1, the CGAS-PARP1 interaction leading to impede the formation of the PARP1-TIMELESS complex (PubMed:30356214, PubMed:31544964). In addition to DNA, also sense translation stress: in response to translation stress, translocates to the cytosol and associates with collided ribosomes, promoting its activation and triggering type-I interferon production (PubMed:34111399).

Probably acts as an amino acid sensor of the Rag GTPases and Ragulator complexes, 2 complexes involved in amino acid sensing and activation of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids (PubMed:25567906, PubMed:29053970). Following activation by amino acids, the Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:25561175, PubMed:25567906). SLC38A9 mediates transport of amino acids with low capacity and specificity with a slight preference for polar amino acids (PubMed:25561175, PubMed:25567906). Acts as an arginine sensor (PubMed:25567906, PubMed:29053970, PubMed:31295473). Following activation by arginine binding, mediates transport of L-glutamine, leucine and tyrosine with high efficiency, and is required for the efficient utilization of these amino acids after lysosomal protein degradation (PubMed:29053970, PubMed:31295473). However, the transport mechanism is not well defined and the role of sodium is not clear (PubMed:25561175, PubMed:31295473). Can disassemble the lysosomal folliculin complex (LFC), and thereby triggers GAP activity of FLCN:FNIP2 toward RRAGC (PubMed:32868926). Acts as an cholesterol sensor that conveys increases in lysosomal cholesterol, leading to lysosomal recruitment and activation of mTORC1 via the Rag GTPases (PubMed:28336668). Guanine exchange factor (GEF) that, upon arginine binding, stimulates GDP release from RRAGA and therefore activates the Rag GTPase heterodimer and the mTORC1 pathway in response to nutrient sufficiency (PubMed:30181260). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25561175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25567906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28336668, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29053970, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30181260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31295473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32868926, ECO:0000305|PubMed:31295473}.

Catalyzes hydrolysis of the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-1 or sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A1 or A2 activity) and transfer it to the hydroxyl group at the first carbon of lipophilic alcohols (O-acyltransferase activity) (PubMed:10092508, PubMed:11790796, PubMed:20410020, PubMed:23958596, PubMed:25727495, PubMed:29724779, PubMed:36823305). Among preferred fatty acyl donors are phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines (PubMed:29724779, PubMed:36823305). Favors sn-2 over sn-1 deacylation of unsaturated fatty acyl groups of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylglycerols (PubMed:36823305). Among preferred fatty acyl acceptors are natural lipophilic alcohols including short-chain ceramide N-acetyl-sphingosine (C2 ceramide), alkylacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols, and acylethanolamides such as anandamide and oleoylethanolamide (PubMed:29724779).

It cleaves pre-tRNA at the 5'- and 3'-splice sites to release the intron. The products are an intron and two tRNA half-molecules bearing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH termini. There are no conserved sequences at the splice sites, but the intron is invariably located at the same site in the gene, placing the splice sites an invariant distance from the constant structural features of the tRNA body. Isoform 1 probably carries the active site for 5'-splice site cleavage. The tRNA splicing endonuclease is also involved in mRNA processing via its association with pre-mRNA 3'-end processing factors, establishing a link between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3'-end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA-processing events. Isoform 2 is responsible for processing a yet unknown RNA substrate.

At the synaptic vesicle membrane, mainly functions as an uniporter that mediates the uptake of L-glutamate into synaptic vesicles at presynaptic nerve terminals of excitatory neural cells (PubMed:12151341). The L-glutamate uniporter activity is electrogenic and is driven by the proton electrochemical gradient, mainly by the electrical gradient established by the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase across the synaptic vesicle membrane (PubMed:12151341). In addition, functions as a chloride channel that allows a chloride permeation through the synaptic vesicle membrane that affects the proton electrochemical gradient and promotes synaptic vesicles acidification (By similarity). At the plasma membrane, following exocytosis, functions as a symporter of Na(+) and phosphate from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm allowing synaptic phosphate homeostasis regulation (Probable). The symporter activity is electrogenic (PubMed:33440152). Moreover, operates synergistically with SLC18A3/VACHT under a constant H(+) gradient, thereby allowing striatal vesicular acetylcholine uptake (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q7TSF2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12151341, ECO:0000305|PubMed:33440152}.

GTPase-activating protein that plays a key role in the cellular response to amino acid availability through regulation of the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling cascade controlling the MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:17028174, PubMed:18663353, PubMed:21209915, PubMed:24081491, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:31672913, PubMed:31704029, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36103527, PubMed:37079666). Activates mTORC1 by acting as a GTPase-activating protein: specifically stimulates GTP hydrolysis by RagC/RRAGC or RagD/RRAGD, promoting the conversion to the GDP-bound state of RagC/RRAGC or RagD/RRAGD, and thereby activating the kinase activity of mTORC1 (PubMed:24095279, PubMed:31672913, PubMed:31704029, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:37079666). The GTPase-activating activity is inhibited during starvation and activated in presence of nutrients (PubMed:31672913, PubMed:32612235). Acts as a key component for non-canonical mTORC1-dependent control of the MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3, while it is not involved in mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of canonical RPS6KB1/S6K1 and EIF4EBP1/4E-BP1 (PubMed:21209915, PubMed:24081491, PubMed:31672913, PubMed:32612235). In low-amino acid conditions, the lysosomal folliculin complex (LFC) is formed on the membrane of lysosomes, which inhibits the GTPase-activating activity of FLCN, inactivates mTORC1 and maximizes nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:31672913). Upon amino acid restimulation, RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) nucleotide exchange promotes disassembly of the LFC complex and liberates the GTPase-activating activity of FLCN, leading to activation of mTORC1 and subsequent cytoplasmic retention of TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:31672913). Indirectly acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling by promoting mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic retention of MiT/TFE factor TFE3 (PubMed:31272105). Required for the exit of hematopoietic stem cell from pluripotency by promoting mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic retention of TFE3, thereby increasing Wnt signaling (PubMed:30733432). Acts as an inhibitor of browning of adipose tissue by regulating mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic retention of TFE3 (By similarity). Involved in the control of embryonic stem cells differentiation; together with LAMTOR1 it is necessary to recruit and activate RagC/RRAGC and RagD/RRAGD at the lysosomes, and to induce exit of embryonic stem cells from pluripotency via non-canonical, mTOR-independent TFE3 inactivation (By similarity). In response to flow stress, regulates STK11/LKB1 accumulation and mTORC1 activation through primary cilia: may act by recruiting STK11/LKB1 to primary cilia for activation of AMPK resided at basal bodies, causing mTORC1 down-regulation (PubMed:27072130). Together with FNIP1 and/or FNIP2, regulates autophagy: following phosphorylation by ULK1, interacts with GABARAP and promotes autophagy (PubMed:25126726). Required for starvation-induced perinuclear clustering of lysosomes by promoting association of RILP with its effector RAB34 (PubMed:27113757).

Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/Rabin8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for Rab8 and then the Rab8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation.

Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Required for the coactivation of estrogen responsive promoters by SWI/SNF complexes and the SRC/p160 family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Also specifically interacts with the CoREST corepressor resulting in repression of neuronal specific gene promoters in non-neuronal cells. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54941, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12672490, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.

Links myosin VI to the Golgi complex and plays an important role in Golgi ribbon formation (PubMed:27534431). Plays a role in the activation of innate immune response during viral infection. Mechanistically, recruits TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus, promoting its trans-phosphorylation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation (PubMed:27538435). In turn, activated TBK1 phosphorylates its downstream partner IRF3 to produce IFN-beta/IFNB1. Plays a neuroprotective role in the eye and optic nerve. May act by regulating membrane trafficking and cellular morphogenesis via a complex that contains Rab8 and huntingtin (HD). Mediates the interaction of Rab8 with the probable GTPase-activating protein TBC1D17 during Rab8-mediated endocytic trafficking, such as that of transferrin receptor (TFRC/TfR); regulates Rab8 recruitment to tubules emanating from the endocytic recycling compartment (PubMed:22854040). Autophagy receptor that interacts directly with both the cargo to become degraded and an autophagy modifier of the MAP1 LC3 family; targets ubiquitin-coated bacteria (xenophagy), such as cytoplasmic Salmonella enterica, and appears to function in the same pathway as SQSTM1 and CALCOCO2/NDP52. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11834836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15837803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20085643, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20174559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21617041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22854040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27534431, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27538435}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) May constitute a cellular target for various viruses, such as adenovirus E3 14.7 or Bluetongue virus, to inhibit innate immune response (PubMed:27538435, PubMed:9488477).

Q96CW1	AP2M1_HUMAN	AP-2 complex subunit mu (AP-2 mu chain) (Adaptin-mu2) (Adaptor protein complex AP-2 subunit mu) (Adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit mu) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 2 mu medium chain) (Clathrin coat assembly protein AP50) (Clathrin coat-associated protein AP50) (HA2 50 kDa subunit) (Plasma membrane adaptor AP-2 50 kDa protein)	Homo sapiens (Human)	435	clathrin adaptor activity [GO:0035615]; disordered domain specific binding [GO:0097718]; lipid binding [GO:0008289]; low-density lipoprotein particle receptor binding [GO:0050750]; signal sequence binding [GO:0005048]; transmembrane transporter binding [GO:0044325]	FUNCTION: Component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:16581796). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (PubMed:12694563, PubMed:12952941, PubMed:14745134, PubMed:14985334, PubMed:15473838, PubMed:31104773). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (By similarity). AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (PubMed:19033387). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 mu subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (By similarity). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (PubMed:11877457). The membrane-specific phosphorylation event appears to involve assembled clathrin which activates the AP-2 mu kinase AAK1 (PubMed:11877457). Plays a role in endocytosis of frizzled family members upon Wnt signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12694563, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12952941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14745134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14985334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15473838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16581796, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23676497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31104773}.

The protease activity is required for proteolytic activation of ATG8 family proteins: cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 proteins MAP1LC3 and GABARAPL2, to reveal a C-terminal glycine (PubMed:21177865). Exposure of the glycine at the C-terminus is essential for ATG8 proteins conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and insertion to membranes, which is necessary for autophagy (By similarity). In addition to the protease activity, also mediates delipidation of ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:33909989). Catalyzes delipidation of PE-conjugated forms of ATG8 proteins during macroautophagy (PubMed:29458288, PubMed:33909989). Compared to ATG4B, the major protein for proteolytic activation of ATG8 proteins, shows weaker ability to cleave the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 proteins, while it displays stronger delipidation activity (PubMed:29458288).

Activated in response to various mitochondrial stress, leading to the proteolytic cleavage of target proteins, such as OPA1, UQCC3 and DELE1 (PubMed:20038677, PubMed:25275009, PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Involved in the fusion of the mitochondrial inner membranes by mediating cleavage of OPA1 at S1 position, generating the soluble OPA1 (S-OPA1), which cooperates with the membrane form (L-OPA1) to coordinate the fusion of mitochondrial inner membranes (PubMed:31922487). Following stress conditions that induce loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mediates cleavage of OPA1, leading to excess production of soluble OPA1 (S-OPA1) and negative regulation of mitochondrial fusion (PubMed:20038677, PubMed:25275009). Involved in mitochondrial safeguard in response to transient mitochondrial membrane depolarization (flickering) by catalyzing cleavage of OPA1, leading to excess production of S-OPA1, preventing mitochondrial hyperfusion (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of apoptosis: upon BAK and BAX aggregation, mediates cleavage of OPA1, leading to the remodeling of mitochondrial cristae and allowing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial cristae (PubMed:25275009). In depolarized mitochondria, may also act as a backup protease for PINK1 by mediating PINK1 cleavage and promoting its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:30733118). May also cleave UQCC3 in response to mitochondrial depolarization (PubMed:25605331). Also acts as an activator of the integrated stress response (ISR): in response to mitochondrial stress, mediates cleavage of DELE1 to generate the processed form of DELE1 (S-DELE1), which translocates to the cytosol and activates EIF2AK1/HRI to trigger the ISR (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707).

As part of the UREL complex, plays a key role in ribosome recycling by promoting mono-ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 subunit of the 60S ribosome (PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 occurs on free 60S ribosomes following ribosome dissociation: it weakens the junction between post-termination 60S subunits and SEC61 translocons, promoting release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 and subsequent 60S ribosome recycling either take place after normal termination of translation or after ribosome stalling during cotranslational translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32851973, PubMed:37595036, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789).

Also acts as a regulator of transcription: negatively regulates NF-kappa-B-mediated gene transcription through the control of RELA phosphorylation (PubMed:17785205, PubMed:20228063). Also regulates mitotic G2/M transition checkpoint and mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint (PubMed:15790566, PubMed:19223857).

Acts by promoting lysis of pathogen-containing vacuoles, releasing pathogens into the cytosol (By similarity). Following pathogen release in the cytosol, promotes recruitment of proteins that mediate bacterial cytolysis: this liberates ligands that are detected by inflammasomes, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that activates the non-canonical CASP4/CASP11 inflammasome or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that activates the AIM2 inflammasome (By similarity). As an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly: promotes selective NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in response to microbial and soluble, but not crystalline, agents (PubMed:22461501). Independently of its GTPase activity, acts as an inhibitor of various viruses infectivity, such as HIV-1, Zika and influenza A viruses, by inhibiting FURIN-mediated maturation of viral envelope proteins (PubMed:26996307, PubMed:31091448). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CFB4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20180847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22461501, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26996307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31091448}.; FUNCTION: Antigenic tumor-specific truncated splice form. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15175044}.

Promotes tRNA repair and recycling downstream of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway by mediating addition of the tRNA 3'-terminal CCA following cleavage by ANKZF1 and repair by ELAC1 (PubMed:31011209). Also involved in tRNA surveillance by mediating tandem CCA addition to generate a CCACCA at the 3' terminus of unstable tRNAs and tRNA-like transcripts (PubMed:22076379, PubMed:25640237). While stable tRNAs receive only 3'-terminal CCA, unstable tRNAs beginning with GG are marked with CCACCA and rapidly degraded (PubMed:22076379, PubMed:25640237). The structural flexibility of RNA controls the choice between CCA versus CCACCA addition: following the first CCA addition cycle, nucleotide-binding to the active site triggers a clockwise screw motion, producing torque on the RNA (PubMed:25640237). This ejects stable RNAs, whereas unstable RNAs are refolded while bound to the enzyme and subjected to a second CCA catalytic cycle (PubMed:25640237). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11504732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22076379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25193871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25640237, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25652405, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29454993, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30959222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31011209, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34023389}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Adds 2 C residues (CC-) to the 3' terminus of tRNA molecules instead of a complete CCA end as isoform 1 does (in vitro). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17204286}.

Pyroptosis triggers the elimination of the infected skin cell, depriving the pathogen of its protective niche, while inducing an inflammatory response (PubMed:35110732, PubMed:35545676). This ultimately prevents bacterial penetration of the epithelial barrier and a subsequent systemic dissemination of the pathogen (PubMed:35110732, PubMed:35545676).

The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/Rabin8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for Rab8 and then the Rab8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation. Required for proper BBSome complex assembly and its ciliary localization. Required for microtubule anchoring at the centrosome but not for microtubule nucleation. May be required for the dynein-mediated transport of pericentriolar proteins to the centrosome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15107855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17574030, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22072986}.	BBS4

Also has weak L-arginine oxidase activity (PubMed:26673964). Acts as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity by mediating Trp degradation via an indole pyruvate pathway that activates the transcription factor AHR (PubMed:32818467, PubMed:32866000). IL4I1-mediated Trp catabolism generates I3P, giving rise to indole metabolites (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-aldehyde (I3A)) and kynurenic acid, which act as ligands for AHR, a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays important roles in immunity and cancer (PubMed:32818467, PubMed:32866000). AHR activation by indoles following IL4I1-mediated Trp degradation enhances tumor progression by promoting cancer cell motility and suppressing adaptive immunity (PubMed:32818467). Also has an immunoregulatory function in some immune cells, probably by mediating Trp degradation and promoting downstream AHR activation: inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation, promotes the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T-cells into FOXP3(+) regulatory T-cells (Treg) and regulates the development and function of B-cells (PubMed:17356132, PubMed:25446972, PubMed:25778793, PubMed:28891065).

Acts as a key regulator of interstrand cross-link repair, which takes place when both strands of duplex DNA are covalently tethered together, thereby blocking replication and transcription (By similarity). Controls the choice between the two pathways of replication-coupled interstrand-cross-link repair by mediating ubiquitination of MCM7 subunit of the CMG helicase complex (By similarity). Short ubiquitin chains on MCM7 promote recruitment of DNA glycosylase NEIL3 (By similarity). If the interstrand cross-link cannot be cleaved by NEIL3, the ubiquitin chains continue to grow on MCM7, promoting the unloading of the CMG helicase complex by the VCP/p97 ATPase, enabling the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway (By similarity). Only catalyzes ubiquitination of MCM7 when forks converge (By similarity). Also involved in the repair of covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) during DNA synthesis: promotes ubiquitination of DPCs, leading to their degradation by the proteasome (By similarity). Has also been proposed to play a role in promoting translesion synthesis by mediating the assembly of 'Lys-63'-linked poly-ubiquitin chains on the Y-family polymerase POLN in order to facilitate bypass of DNA lesions and preserve genomic integrity (PubMed:24553286). The function in translesion synthesis is however controversial (PubMed:26595769). Acts as a regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint (PubMed:25335891). Also acts as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling by inhibiting activation of NF-kappa-B mediated by TNF (PubMed:22945920). Negatively regulates TLR3/4- and RIG-I-mediated IRF3 activation and subsequent IFNB1 production and cellular antiviral response by promoting 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of TNK1 leading to its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:22945920). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6NRV0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22945920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24553286, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25335891, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26595769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26711499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26781088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27462463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31545170}.

Does not act on ceramide 1-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid or phosphatidic acid (PubMed:16782891). Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase activity is needed for efficient recycling of sphingosine into the sphingolipid synthesis pathway (PubMed:11756451, PubMed:12815058, PubMed:16782891). Regulates the intracellular levels of the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite S1P that regulates diverse biological processes acting both as an extracellular receptor ligand or as an intracellular second messenger (PubMed:11756451, PubMed:12815058, PubMed:16782891). Involved in efficient ceramide synthesis from exogenous sphingoid bases. Converts S1P to sphingosine, which is readily metabolized to ceramide via ceramide synthase. In concert with sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), recycles sphingosine into ceramide through a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle (By similarity). Regulates endoplasmic-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramides, resulting in the regulation of ceramide levels in the endoplasmic reticulum, preferentially long-chain ceramide species, and influences the anterograde membrane transport of both ceramide and proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:16782891).

It phosphorylates mitochondrial proteins to coordinate mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove and replace dysfunctional mitochondrial components (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:18443288, PubMed:18957282, PubMed:19229105, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20547144, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23754282, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:24898855, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32484300). Depending on the severity of mitochondrial damage, activity ranges from preventing apoptosis and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis to eliminating severely damaged mitochondria via PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:18443288, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24898855, PubMed:32047033, PubMed:32484300). When cellular stress results in irreversible mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) where it phosphorylates pre-existing polyubiquitin chains at 'Ser-65', recruits PRKN from the cytosol to the OMM and activates PRKN by phosphorylation at 'Ser-65'; activated PRKN then ubiquinates VDAC1 and other OMM proteins to initiate mitophagy (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:23754282, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32047033). The PINK1-PRKN pathway also promotes fission of damaged mitochondria through phosphorylation and PRKN-dependent degradation of mitochondrial proteins involved in fission such as MFN2 (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:24898855). This prevents the refusion of unhealthy mitochondria with the mitochondrial network or initiates mitochondrial fragmentation facilitating their later engulfment by autophagosomes (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:23620051). Also promotes mitochondrial fission independently of PRKN and ATG7-mediated mitophagy, via the phosphorylation and activation of DNM1L (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:32484300). Regulates motility of damaged mitochondria by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MIRO1 and MIRO2; in motor neurons, this likely inhibits mitochondrial intracellular anterograde transport along the axons which probably increases the chance of the mitochondria undergoing mitophagy in the soma (PubMed:22396657). Required for ubiquinone reduction by mitochondrial complex I by mediating phosphorylation of complex I subunit NDUFA10 (By similarity). Phosphorylates LETM1, positively regulating its mitochondrial calcium transport activity (PubMed:29123128). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q99MQ3, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14607334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15087508, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18443288, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18957282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19229105, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19966284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20404107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20798600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22396657, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23620051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23754282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23933751, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24660806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24751536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24784582, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24898855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25474007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25527291, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29123128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32047033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32484300}.

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming queuine, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product (By similarity).

M6A is a modification present at internal sites of mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs and plays a role in mRNA stability and processing (PubMed:24284625, PubMed:32492408). Acts as a regulator of mRNA stability by promoting degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex (PubMed:32492408).

Functions as an E3 ligase for oxidized IREB2 and both heme and oxygen are necessary for IREB2 ubiquitination (PubMed:12629548). Promotes ubiquitination of TAB2 and IRF3 and their degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:17449468, PubMed:18711448). Component of the LUBAC complex which conjugates linear ('Met-1'-linked) polyubiquitin chains to substrates and plays a key role in NF-kappa-B activation and regulation of inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331).

Q9H171	ZBP1_HUMAN	Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors) (DAI) (Tumor stroma and activated macrophage protein DLM-1)	Homo sapiens (Human)	429	DNA binding [GO:0003677]; double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase activity [GO:0003726]; double-stranded RNA binding [GO:0003725]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; left-handed Z-DNA binding [GO:0003692]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]	FUNCTION: Key innate sensor that recognizes and binds Z-RNA structures, which are produced by a number of viruses, such as herpesvirus, orthomyxovirus or flavivirus, and triggers different forms of cell death (PubMed:32200799). ZBP1 acts as an essential mediator of pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis (PANoptosis), an integral part of host defense against pathogens, by activating RIPK3, caspase-8 (CASP8), and the NLRP3 inflammasome (By similarity). Key activator of necroptosis, a programmed cell death process in response to death-inducing TNF-alpha family members, via its ability to bind Z-RNA: once activated upon Z-RNA-binding, ZBP1 interacts and stimulates RIPK3 kinase, which phosphorylates and activates MLKL, triggering execution of programmed necrosis (By similarity). In addition to TNF-induced necroptosis, necroptosis can also take place in the nucleus in response to orthomyxoviruses infection: ZBP1 recognizes and binds Z-RNA structures that are produced in infected nuclei by orthomyxoviruses, such as the influenza A virus (IAV), leading to ZBP1 activation, RIPK3 stimulation and subsequent MLKL phosphorylation, triggering disruption of the nuclear envelope and leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol (PubMed:32200799). ZBP1-dependent cell death in response to IAV infection promotes interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A) induction in an NLRP3-inflammasome-independent manner: IL1A expression is required for the optimal interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) production, and together, these cytokines promote infiltration of inflammatory neutrophils to the lung, leading to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (By similarity). In addition to its direct role in driving necroptosis via its ability to sense Z-RNAs, also involved in PANoptosis triggered in response to bacterial infection: component of the AIM2 PANoptosome complex, a multiprotein complex that triggers PANoptosis (By similarity). Also acts as the apical sensor of fungal infection responsible for activating PANoptosis (By similarity). Involved in CASP8-mediated cell death via its interaction with RIPK1 but independently of its ability to sense Z-RNAs (By similarity). In some cell types, also able to restrict viral replication by promoting cell death-independent responses (By similarity). In response to Zika virus infection in neurons, promotes a cell death-independent pathway that restricts viral replication: together with RIPK3, promotes a death-independent transcriptional program that modifies the cellular metabolism via up-regulation expression of the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate (By similarity). Itaconate inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QY24, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32200799}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of herpes simplex virus 1/HHV-1 infection, forms hetero-amyloid structures with HHV-1 protein RIR1/ICP6 which may inhibit ZBP1-mediated necroptosis, thereby preventing host cell death pathway and allowing viral evasion. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:33348174}.

CARD9-mediated signals are essential for antifungal immunity against a subset of fungi from the phylum Ascomycota (PubMed:24231284, PubMed:25057046, PubMed:25702837, PubMed:26521038, PubMed:26679537, PubMed:26961233, PubMed:27777981, PubMed:29080677, PubMed:33558980). Transduces signals in myeloid cells downstream of C-type lectin receptors CLEC7A (dectin-1), CLEC6A (dectin-2) and CLEC4E (Mincle), which detect pathogen-associated molecular pattern metabolites (PAMPs), such as fungal carbohydrates, and trigger CARD9 activation (By similarity). Upon activation, CARD9 homooligomerizes to form a nucleating helical template that recruits BCL10 via CARD-CARD interaction, thereby promoting polymerization of BCL10 and subsequent recruitment of MALT1: this leads to activation of NF-kappa-B and MAP kinase p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and/or MAPK14) pathways which stimulate expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (PubMed:11053425, PubMed:26488816, PubMed:26961233, PubMed:31296852, PubMed:33558980). CARD9 signaling in antigen-presenting cells links innate sensing of fungi to the activation of adaptive immunity and provides a cytokine milieu that induces the development and subsequent of interleukin 17-producing T helper (Th17) cells (PubMed:24231284). Also involved in activation of myeloid cells via classical ITAM-associated receptors and TLR: required for TLR-mediated activation of MAPK, while it is not required for TLR-induced activation of NF-kappa-B (By similarity). CARD9 can also be engaged independently of BCL10: forms a complex with RASGRF1 downstream of C-type lectin receptors, which recruits and activates HRAS, leading to ERK activation and the production of cytokines (By similarity). Acts as an important regulator of the intestinal commensal fungi (mycobiota) component of the gut microbiota (PubMed:33548172). Plays an essential role in antifungal immunity against dissemination of gut fungi: acts by promoting induction of antifungal IgG antibodies response in CX3CR1(+) macrophages to confer protection against disseminated C.albicans or C.auris infection (PubMed:33548172). Also mediates immunity against other pathogens, such as certain bacteria, viruses and parasites; CARD9 signaling is however redundant with other innate immune responses (By similarity). In response to L.monocytogenes infection, required for the production of inflammatory cytokines activated by intracellular peptidoglycan: acts by connecting NOD2 recognition of peptidoglycan to downstream activation of MAP kinases (MAPK) without activating NF-kappa-B (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2AIV8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11053425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24231284, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25057046, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25702837, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26488816, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26521038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26679537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26961233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27777981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29080677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31296852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33548172, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33558980}.

Q9H2S1	KCNN2_HUMAN	Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 2 (SK2) (SKCa 2) (SKCa2) (KCa2.2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	579	alpha-actinin binding [GO:0051393]; calcium-activated potassium channel activity [GO:0015269]; calmodulin binding [GO:0005516]; inward rectifier potassium channel activity [GO:0005242]; protein domain specific binding [GO:0019904]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel activity [GO:0016286]	FUNCTION: Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that mediates the voltage-independent transmembrane transfer of potassium across the cell membrane through a constitutive interaction with calmodulin which binds the intracellular calcium allowing its opening (PubMed:10991935, PubMed:33242881, PubMed:9287325). The current is characterized by a voltage-independent activation, an intracellular calcium concentration increase-dependent activation and a single-channel conductance of about 3 picosiemens (PubMed:10991935). Also presents an inwardly rectifying current, thus reducing its already small outward conductance of potassium ions, which is particularly the case when the membrane potential displays positive values, above + 20 mV (PubMed:10991935). The inward rectification could be due to a blockade of the outward current by intracellular divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium and could also be due to an intrinsic property of the channel pore, independent of intracellular divalent ions. There are three positively charged amino acids in the S6 transmembrane domain, close to the pore, that collectively control the conductance and rectification through an electrostatic mechanism. Additionally, electrostatic contributions from these residues also play an important role in determining the intrinsic open probability of the channel in the absence of calcium, affecting the apparent calcium affinity for activation. Forms an heteromeric complex with calmodulin, which is constitutively associated in a calcium-independent manner. Channel opening is triggered when calcium binds the calmodulin resulting in a rotary movement leading to the formation of the dimeric complex to open the gate (By similarity). Plays a role in the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential (PubMed:13679367). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P70604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10991935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:13679367, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33242881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9287325}.

The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases.

The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. Catalyzes, on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, the addition of the second and third mannose residues to the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide chain, to produce Man3GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol core oligosaccharide. Man3GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol is a substrate for ALG11, the following enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway (PubMed:12684507, PubMed:35136180). While both alpha 1,3 and alpha 1,6 linkages are possible, the sequential addition of alpha 1,3 followed by alpha 1,6 is probably the preferred route (PubMed:35136180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12684507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35136180}.

In the heterodimer formed with METTL3, METTL14 constitutes the RNA-binding scaffold that recognizes the substrate rather than the catalytic core (PubMed:27281194, PubMed:27373337, PubMed:27627798, PubMed:29348140). N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which takes place at the 5'-[AG]GAC-3' consensus sites of some mRNAs, plays a role in mRNA stability and processing (PubMed:24316715, PubMed:24407421, PubMed:25719671). M6A acts as a key regulator of mRNA stability by promoting mRNA destabilization and degradation (By similarity).

The MSL complex is required for chromosome stability and genome integrity by maintaining homeostatic levels of H4K16ac (PubMed:33837287). The MSL complex is also involved in gene dosage by promoting up-regulation of genes expressed by the X chromosome (By similarity). X up-regulation is required to compensate for autosomal biallelic expression (By similarity). The MSL complex also participates in gene dosage compensation by promoting expression of Tsix non-coding RNA (By similarity). MSL2 plays a key role in gene dosage by ensuring biallelic expression of a subset of dosage-sensitive genes, including many haploinsufficient genes (By similarity). Acts by promoting promoter-enhancer contacts, thereby preventing DNA methylation of one allele and creating a methylation-free environment for methylation-sensitive transcription factors such as SP1, KANSL1 and KANSL3 (By similarity). Also acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes monoubiquitination of histone H2B at 'Lys-35' (H2BK34Ub), but not that of H2A (PubMed:21726816, PubMed:30930284). This activity is greatly enhanced by heterodimerization with MSL1 (PubMed:21726816, PubMed:30930284). H2B ubiquitination in turn stimulates histone H3 methylation at 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) and leads to gene activation, including that of HOXA9 and MEIS1 (PubMed:21726816).

This transcript 'caging' into mRNPs allows mRNA transport and transient storage. It also modulates the rate and location at which target transcripts encounter the translational apparatus and shields them from endonuclease attacks or microRNA-mediated degradation. Preferentially binds to N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs and increases their stability (PubMed:29476152, PubMed:32245947). Plays a direct role in the transport and translation of transcripts required for axonal regeneration in adult sensory neurons (By similarity). Regulates localized beta-actin/ACTB mRNA translation, a crucial process for cell polarity, cell migration and neurite outgrowth. Co-transcriptionally associates with the ACTB mRNA in the nucleus. This binding involves a conserved 54-nucleotide element in the ACTB mRNA 3'-UTR, known as the 'zipcode'. The RNP thus formed is exported to the cytoplasm, binds to a motor protein and is transported along the cytoskeleton to the cell periphery. During transport, prevents ACTB mRNA from being translated into protein. When the RNP complex reaches its destination near the plasma membrane, IGF2BP1 is phosphorylated. This releases the mRNA, allowing ribosomal 40S and 60S subunits to assemble and initiate ACTB protein synthesis. Monomeric ACTB then assembles into the subcortical actin cytoskeleton (By similarity). During neuronal development, key regulator of neurite outgrowth, growth cone guidance and neuronal cell migration, presumably through the spatiotemporal fine tuning of protein synthesis, such as that of ACTB (By similarity). May regulate mRNA transport to activated synapses (By similarity). Binds to and stabilizes ABCB1/MDR-1 mRNA (By similarity). During interstinal wound repair, interacts with and stabilizes PTGS2 transcript. PTGS2 mRNA stabilization may be crucial for colonic mucosal wound healing (By similarity). Binds to the 3'-UTR of IGF2 mRNA by a mechanism of cooperative and sequential dimerization and regulates IGF2 mRNA subcellular localization and translation. Binds to MYC mRNA, in the coding region instability determinant (CRD) of the open reading frame (ORF), hence preventing MYC cleavage by endonucleases and possibly microRNA targeting to MYC-CRD (PubMed:29476152). Binding to MYC mRNA is enhanced by m6A-modification of the CRD (PubMed:29476152). Binds to the 3'-UTR of CD44 mRNA and stabilizes it, hence promotes cell adhesion and invadopodia formation in cancer cells. Binds to the oncofetal H19 transcript and to the neuron-specific TAU mRNA and regulates their localizations. Binds to and stabilizes BTRC/FBW1A mRNA. Binds to the adenine-rich autoregulatory sequence (ARS) located in PABPC1 mRNA and represses its translation. PABPC1 mRNA-binding is stimulated by PABPC1 protein. Prevents BTRC/FBW1A mRNA degradation by disrupting microRNA-dependent interaction with AGO2. Promotes the directed movement of tumor-derived cells by fine-tuning intracellular signaling networks. Binds to MAPK4 3'-UTR and inhibits its translation. Interacts with PTEN transcript open reading frame (ORF) and prevents mRNA decay. This combined action on MAPK4 (down-regulation) and PTEN (up-regulation) antagonizes HSPB1 phosphorylation, consequently it prevents G-actin sequestration by phosphorylated HSPB1, allowing F-actin polymerization. Hence enhances the velocity of cell migration and stimulates directed cell migration by PTEN-modulated polarization. Interacts with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR and specifically enhances translation at the HCV IRES, but not 5'-cap-dependent translation, possibly by recruiting eIF3. Interacts with HIV-1 GAG protein and blocks the formation of infectious HIV-1 particles. Reduces HIV-1 assembly by inhibiting viral RNA packaging, as well as assembly and processing of GAG protein on cellular membranes. During cellular stress, such as oxidative stress or heat shock, stabilizes target mRNAs that are recruited to stress granules, including CD44, IGF2, MAPK4, MYC, PTEN, RAPGEF2 and RPS6KA5 transcripts. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10875929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16356927, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16541107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16778892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17255263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17893325, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18385235, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19029303, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19541769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19647520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20080952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29476152, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32245947, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8132663, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9891060}.

In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation. AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. AMPK also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin. The AMPK gamma3 subunit is a non-catalytic subunit with a regulatory role in muscle energy metabolism (PubMed:17878938).

Agonist binding induces a conformation change that leads to the opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma membrane (PubMed:11752216, PubMed:25282151). The channel is permeable to a range of divalent cations including calcium, the influx of which may activate a potassium current which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane (PubMed:11752216, PubMed:25282151). In the ear, this may lead to a reduction in basilar membrane motion, altering the activity of auditory nerve fibers and reducing the range of dynamic hearing.

Mediates glutamate, aspartate or serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins: the ADP-D-ribosyl group of NAD(+) is transferred to the acceptor carboxyl group of target residues and further ADP-ribosyl groups are transferred to the 2'-position of the terminal adenosine moiety, building up a polymer with an average chain length of 20-30 units (PubMed:25043379, PubMed:30104678, PubMed:30321391). Serine ADP-ribosylation of proteins constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage (PubMed:32939087). Mediates glutamate and aspartate ADP-ribosylation of target proteins in absence of HPF1 (PubMed:25043379). Following interaction with HPF1, catalyzes serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins; HPF1 conferring serine specificity by completing the PARP2 active site (PubMed:28190768, PubMed:32028527, PubMed:34108479, PubMed:34486521, PubMed:34874266). PARP2 initiates the repair of double-strand DNA breaks: recognizes and binds DNA breaks within chromatin and recruits HPF1, licensing serine ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, such as histones, thereby promoting decompaction of chromatin and the recruitment of repair factors leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks (PubMed:10364231, PubMed:32939087, PubMed:34108479). HPF1 initiates serine ADP-ribosylation but restricts the polymerase activity of PARP2 in order to limit the length of poly-ADP-ribose chains (PubMed:34732825, PubMed:34795260). Specifically mediates formation of branched poly-ADP-ribosylation (PubMed:30104678). Branched poly-ADP-ribose chains are specifically recognized by some factors, such as APLF (PubMed:30104678).

In contrast, does not mediate ubiquitination of TTI1 and TELO2 when they are part of the mTORC2 complex. As a consequence, mTORC1 is inactivated to restrain cell growth and protein translation, while mTORC2 is the activated due to the relief of feedback inhibition by mTORC1 (PubMed:23263282). Plays a role in maintaining epithelial cell survival by regulating the turn-over of chromatin modulator PRMT4 through ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal pathway (PubMed:34480022).

Activates transcription of a set of genes important for Th1 cell function, including those encoding IFN-gamma and the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Induces permissive chromatin accessibilty and CpG methylation in IFNG (PubMed:33296702). Activates IFNG and CXCR3 genes in part by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes including KDM6B, a SMARCA4-containing SWI/SNF-complex, and an H3K4me2-methyltransferase complex to their promoters and all of these complexes serve to establish a more permissive chromatin state conducive with transcriptional activation (By similarity). Can activate Th1 genes also via recruitment of Mediator complex and P-TEFb (composed of CDK9 and CCNT1/cyclin-T1) in the form of the super elongation complex (SEC) to super-enhancers and associated genes in activated Th1 cells (PubMed:27292648). Inhibits the Th17 cell lineage commitment by blocking RUNX1-mediated transactivation of Th17 cell-specific transcriptinal regulator RORC. Inhibits the Th2 cell lineage commitment by suppressing the production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL- 13, via repression of transcriptional regulators GATA3 and NFATC2. Protects Th1 cells from amplifying aberrant type-I IFN response in an IFN-gamma abundant microenvironment by acting as a repressor of type-I IFN transcription factors and type-I IFN-stimulated genes. Acts as a regulator of antiviral B-cell responses; controls chronic viral infection by promoting the antiviral antibody IgG2a isotype switching and via regulation of a broad antiviral gene expression program (By similarity).

Most frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK-3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and activation of Wnt target genes (PubMed:30135577). Plays a critical role in retinal vascularization by acting as a receptor for Wnt proteins and norrin (NDP) (By similarity). In retina, it can be activated by Wnt protein-binding and also by Wnt-independent signaling via binding of norrin (NDP), promoting in both cases beta-catenin (CTNNB1) accumulation and stimulation of LEF/TCF-mediated transcriptional programs (By similarity). A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase.

Associates with the APC/C in late mitosis, in replacement of CDC20, and activates the APC/C during anaphase and telophase. The APC/C remains active in degrading substrates to ensure that positive regulators of the cell cycle do not accumulate prematurely. At the G1/S transition FZR1 is phosphorylated, leading to its dissociation from the APC/C. Following DNA damage, it is required for the G2 DNA damage checkpoint: its dephosphorylation and reassociation with the APC/C leads to the ubiquitination of PLK1, preventing entry into mitosis. Acts as an adapter for APC/C to target the DNA-end resection factor RBBP8/CtIP for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Through the regulation of RBBP8/CtIP protein turnover, may play a role in DNA damage response, favoring DNA double-strand repair through error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) over error-free, RBBP8-mediated homologous recombination (HR) (PubMed:25349192). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14701726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18662541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21596315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25349192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9734353}.

Ubiquitination of PRPF3 allows its recognition by the U5 component PRPF8 and stabilizes the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP spliceosomal complex (PubMed:20595234). Recruited to RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and the pre-mRNA, it may also couple the transcriptional and spliceosomal machineries (PubMed:21536736). The XAB2 complex, which contains PRPF19, is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription and transcription-coupled repair (PubMed:17981804). Beside its role in pre-mRNA splicing PRPF19, as part of the PRP19-CDC5L complex, plays a role in the DNA damage response/DDR. It is recruited to the sites of DNA damage by the RPA complex where PRPF19 directly ubiquitinates RPA1 and RPA2. 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the RPA complex allows the recruitment of the ATR-ATRIP complex and the activation of ATR, a master regulator of the DNA damage response (PubMed:24332808).

Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full-length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL) (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:28965847). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:28965847). Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:28965847). When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A) (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:28965847).

Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation (PubMed:11408476, PubMed:11821383, PubMed:15030775, PubMed:36357533). Acts as a recognition receptor (PRR): recognizes specific pathogens and other damage-associated signals, such as HIV-1 protease activity or Val-boroPro inhibitor, and mediates CARD8 inflammasome activation (PubMed:32840892, PubMed:33542150, PubMed:36357533). In response to pathogen-associated signals, the N-terminal part of CARD8 is degraded by the proteasome, releasing the cleaved C-terminal part of the protein (Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8, C-terminus), which polymerizes to initiate the formation of the inflammasome complex: the CARD8 inflammasome directly recruits pro-caspase-1 (proCASP1) independently of PYCARD/ASC and promotes caspase-1 (CASP1) activation, which subsequently cleaves and activates inflammatory cytokines IL1B and IL18 and gasdermin-D (GSDMD), leading to pyroptosis (PubMed:32051255, PubMed:32840892, PubMed:33053349, PubMed:33542150, PubMed:36357533). Ability to sense HIV-1 protease activity leads to the clearance of latent HIV-1 in patient CD4(+) T-cells after viral reactivation; in contrast, HIV-1 can evade CARD8-sensing when its protease remains inactive in infected cells prior to viral budding (PubMed:33542150).

Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process in response to death-inducing TNF-alpha family members, is triggered by RIPK3 following activation by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:29883609, PubMed:32298652).

In addition to TNF-induced necroptosis, necroptosis can also take place in the nucleus in response to orthomyxoviruses infection: following ZBP1 activation, which senses double-stranded Z-RNA structures, nuclear RIPK3 catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of MLKL, promoting disruption of the nuclear envelope and leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol (By similarity). Also regulates apoptosis: apoptosis depends on RIPK1, FADD and CASP8, and is independent of MLKL and RIPK3 kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylates RIPK1: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). In some cell types, also able to restrict viral replication by promoting cell death-independent responses (By similarity). In response to Zika virus infection in neurons, promotes a cell death-independent pathway that restricts viral replication: together with ZBP1, promotes a death-independent transcriptional program that modifies the cellular metabolism via up-regulation expression of the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate (By similarity). Itaconate inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). RIPK3 binds to and enhances the activity of three metabolic enzymes: GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL (PubMed:19498109). These metabolic enzymes may eventually stimulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which could result in enhanced ROS production (PubMed:19498109). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QZL0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19498109, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22421439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25316792, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29883609, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32298652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32657447}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) In case of herpes simplex virus 1/HHV-1 infection, forms heteromeric amyloid structures with HHV-1 protein RIR1/ICP6 which may inhibit RIPK3-mediated necroptosis, thereby preventing host cell death pathway and allowing viral evasion. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:33348174}.

Stimulates the degradation of kinetochore ZW10 interacting protein ZWINT in a proteasome-dependent manner, leading to negative regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:22023800). Inhibits autophagic degradation of diverse known targets while contributing to autophagy of midbodies. Autophagy-inhibitory activity involves MCL1, which TRIM17 assembles into complexes with the key autophagy regulator BECN1 (PubMed:27562068). Controls neuronal apoptosis by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of MCL1 to initiate neuronal death. In addition, regulates NFAT transcription factors NFATC3 and NFATC4 activities by preventing their nuclear localization, thus inhibiting their transcriptional activities. Decreases TRIM41-mediated degradation of ZSCAN2 thereby stimulating alpha-synuclein/SNCA transcription in neuronal cells (By similarity).

Q9Y5A9	YTHD2_HUMAN	YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (DF2) (CLL-associated antigen KW-14) (High-glucose-regulated protein 8) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-2)	Homo sapiens (Human)	579	C5-methylcytidine-containing RNA reader activity [GO:0062153]; mRNA binding [GO:0003729]; N6-methyladenosine-containing RNA reader activity [GO:1990247]; RNA binding [GO:0003723]	FUNCTION: Specifically recognizes and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing RNAs, and regulates their stability (PubMed:24284625, PubMed:26046440, PubMed:26318451, PubMed:32492408). M6A is a modification present at internal sites of mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs and plays a role in mRNA stability and processing (PubMed:22575960, PubMed:24284625, PubMed:25412658, PubMed:25412661, PubMed:32492408). Acts as a regulator of mRNA stability by promoting degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with the CCR4-NOT and ribonuclease P/MRP complexes, depending on the context (PubMed:24284625, PubMed:26046440, PubMed:27558897, PubMed:30930054, PubMed:32492408). The YTHDF paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) share m6A-containing mRNAs targets and act redundantly to mediate mRNA degradation and cellular differentiation (PubMed:28106072, PubMed:32492408). M6A-containing mRNAs containing a binding site for RIDA/HRSP12 (5'-GGUUC-3') are preferentially degraded by endoribonucleolytic cleavage: cooperative binding of RIDA/HRSP12 and YTHDF2 to transcripts leads to recruitment of the ribonuclease P/MRP complex (PubMed:30930054). Other m6A-containing mRNAs undergo deadenylation via direct interaction between YTHDF2 and CNOT1, leading to recruitment of the CCR4-NOT and subsequent deadenylation of m6A-containing mRNAs (PubMed:27558897). Required maternally to regulate oocyte maturation: probably acts by binding to m6A-containing mRNAs, thereby regulating maternal transcript dosage during oocyte maturation, which is essential for the competence of oocytes to sustain early zygotic development (By similarity). Also required during spermatogenesis: regulates spermagonial adhesion by promoting degradation of m6A-containing transcripts coding for matrix metallopeptidases (By similarity). Also involved in hematopoietic stem cells specification by binding to m6A-containing mRNAs, leading to promote their degradation (PubMed:30065315). Also acts as a regulator of neural development by promoting m6A-dependent degradation of neural development-related mRNA targets (By similarity). Inhibits neural specification of induced pluripotent stem cells by binding to methylated neural-specific mRNAs and promoting their degradation, thereby restraining neural differentiation (PubMed:32169943). Regulates circadian regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism: acts by promoting m6A-dependent degradation of PPARA transcripts (PubMed:30428350). Regulates the innate immune response to infection by inhibiting the type I interferon response: acts by binding to m6A-containing IFNB transcripts and promoting their degradation (PubMed:30559377). May also act as a promoter of cap-independent mRNA translation following heat shock stress: upon stress, relocalizes to the nucleus and specifically binds mRNAs with some m6A methylation mark at their 5'-UTR, protecting demethylation of mRNAs by FTO, thereby promoting cap-independent mRNA translation (PubMed:26458103). Regulates mitotic entry by promoting the phase-specific m6A-dependent degradation of WEE1 transcripts (PubMed:32267835). Promotes formation of phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies or stress granules, by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation upon binding to mRNAs containing multiple m6A-modified residues: polymethylated mRNAs act as a multivalent scaffold for the binding of YTHDF proteins, juxtaposing their disordered regions and thereby leading to phase separation (PubMed:31292544, PubMed:31388144, PubMed:31642031, PubMed:32451507). The resulting mRNA-YTHDF complexes then partition into different endogenous phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies, stress granules or neuronal RNA granules (PubMed:31292544). May also recognize and bind RNAs modified by C5-methylcytosine (m5C) and act as a regulator of rRNA processing (PubMed:31815440). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q91YT7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22575960, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24284625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25412658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25412661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26046440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26318451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26458103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27558897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28106072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30065315, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30428350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30559377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30930054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31292544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31388144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31642031, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31815440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32169943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32267835, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32451507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32492408}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Promotes viral gene expression and replication of polyomavirus SV40: acts by binding to N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing viral RNAs (PubMed:29447282). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:29447282}.; FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Promotes viral gene expression and virion production of kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) at some stage of the KSHV life cycle (in iSLK.219 and iSLK.BAC16 cells) (PubMed:29659627).

Proposed to play a role in the trafficking of energy substrates to either storage or oxidative tissues in response to food intake (By similarity). Has a stimulatory effect on plasma triglycerides (TG), which is achieved by suppressing plasma TG clearance via inhibition of LPL activity. The inhibition of LPL activity appears to be an indirect mechanism involving recruitment of proprotein convertases PCSK6 and FURIN to LPL leading to cleavage and dissociation of LPL from the cell surface; the function does not require ANGPTL3 proteolytic cleavage but seems to be mediated by the N-terminal domain, and is not inhibited by GPIHBP1 (PubMed:12097324, PubMed:19318355, PubMed:20581395). Can inhibit endothelial lipase, causing increased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and phospholipids (PubMed:17110602, PubMed:19028676). Can bind to adipocytes to activate lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol (PubMed:12565906). Suppresses LPL specifically in oxidative tissues which is required to route very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG to white adipose tissue (WAT) for storage in response to food; the function may involve cooperation with circulating, liver-derived ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL4 expression in WAT (By similarity). Contributes to lower plasma levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by a mechanism that is independent of the canonical pathway implicating APOE and LDLR. May stimulate hypothalamic LPL activity (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11788823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12097324, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12565906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12909640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17110602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19028676, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19318355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20581395, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23661675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25495645, ECO:0000305|PubMed:20581395}.; FUNCTION: [ANGPTL3(17-221)]: In vitro inhibits LPL activity; not effective on GPIHBP1-stabilized LPL. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19542565}.; FUNCTION: Involved in angiogenesis.

Q9Y5Q0	FADS3_HUMAN	Fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) (EC 1.14.19.-) (Delta(13) fatty acid desaturase) (Delta(13) desaturase)	Homo sapiens (Human)	445	oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with oxidation of a pair of donors resulting in the reduction of molecular oxygen to two molecules of water [GO:0016717]	FUNCTION: Mammals have different sphingoid bases that differ in their length and/or pattern of desaturation and hydroxyl groups. The predominant sphingoid base that comprises mammalian ceramides is sphing-4-enine (sphingosine or SPH) which has a trans (E) desaturation at carbon 4 (PubMed:31862735, PubMed:31916624). FADS3 is a desaturase that introduces a cis (Z) double bond between carbon 14 and carbon 15 of the sphingoid base (also known as long chain base, LCB), producing LCBs such as sphinga-4,14-dienine (SPD, d18:2(4E,14Z)) from SPH (PubMed:31862735, PubMed:31916624, PubMed:37209771). Prefers SPH-containing ceramides (N-acylsphing-4-enines) as substrates (PubMed:31862735, PubMed:31916624, PubMed:37209771). Capable of metabolizing also the SPH in its free form (PubMed:31862735). SPD ceramides occur widely in mammalian tissues and cells (PubMed:31916624). Due to their unusual structure containing a cis double bond, SPD ceramides may have an opposite, negative role in lipid microdomain formation relative to conventional ceramides (PubMed:31916624). Could be involved in the detoxification of 1-deoxy sphingolipids, by desaturating the cytotoxic 1-deoxysphinganine (1-deoxySA, m18:0), produced under pathological conditions, to 1-deoxysphingenine (1-deoxysphingosine, 1-deoxySO, m18:1) (Probable). Although prefers SPH-containing ceramides (N-acylsphing-4-enines) as substrates, it also exhibits activity toward dihydrosphingosine-containing CERs (N-acylsphinganines) and produces 14Z-SPH-containing sphingolipids,which can be found in patients with DEGS1 mutations (PubMed:37209771). Its desaturase mechanism involves an electron transfer facilitated by cytochrome b5 (PubMed:37209771). FADS3 also acts as a methyl-end fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase that introduces a cis double bond between the preexisting double bond and the terminal methyl group of the fatty acyl chain (By similarity). Desaturates (11E)-octadecenoate (trans-vaccenoate, the predominant trans fatty acid in human milk) at carbon 13 to generate (11E,13Z)-octadecadienoate (also known as conjugated linoleic acid 11E,13Z-CLA) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8K1P9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31862735, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31916624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:37209771, ECO:0000305|PubMed:31862735}.

Forms a complex with TMC6/EVER1 and TMC8/EVER2 at the ER membrane of keratynocytes which facilitates zinc uptake into the ER (PubMed:18158319). Down-regulates the activity of transcription factors induced by zinc and cytokines (PubMed:18158319). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18158319, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31471319, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32441444}.

Q9Y6P5	SESN1_HUMAN	Sestrin-1 (EC 1.11.1.-) (p53-regulated protein PA26)	Homo sapiens (Human)	492	L-leucine binding [GO:0070728]; oxidoreductase activity, acting on peroxide as acceptor [GO:0016684]	FUNCTION: Functions as an intracellular leucine sensor that negatively regulates the TORC1 signaling pathway through the GATOR complex. In absence of leucine, binds the GATOR subcomplex GATOR2 and prevents TORC1 signaling. Binding of leucine to SESN2 disrupts its interaction with GATOR2 thereby activating the TORC1 signaling pathway (PubMed:25263562, PubMed:26449471). This stress-inducible metabolic regulator may also play a role in protection against oxidative and genotoxic stresses (By similarity). May positively regulate the transcription by NFE2L2 of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress by facilitating the SQSTM1-mediated autophagic degradation of KEAP1 (PubMed:23274085). Moreover, may prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity born by the N-terminal domain of the protein (By similarity). Was originally reported to contribute to oxidative stress resistance by reducing PRDX1 (PubMed:15105503). However, this could not be confirmed (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P58004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15105503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23274085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25263562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26449471}.
