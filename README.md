# Predicting Protein Function with Transformer Networks in a Learned Sequence Embedding Space

This repository contains the code for my senior thesis on protein function prediction using Transformer networks and ESM-2 embeddings. It includes data preprocessing scripts, model training pipelines, and evaluation metrics for multi-label classification on molecular-function Gene Ontology terms.
